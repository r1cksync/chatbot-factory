Preface
Linear algebra has in recent years become an essential part of the mathematical background required by
mathematicians and mathematics teachers, engineers, computer scientists, physicists, economists, and
statisticians, among others. This requirement reﬂects the importance and wide applications of the subject
matter.
This book is designed for use as a textbook for a formal course in linear algebra or as a supplement to all
current standard texts. It aims to present an introduction to linear algebra which will be found helpful to all
readers regardless of their ﬁelds of speciﬁcation. More material has been included than can be covered in most
ﬁrst courses. This has been done to make the book more ﬂexible, to provide a useful book of reference, and to
stimulate further interest in the subject.
Each chapter begins with clear statements of pertinent deﬁnitions, principles, and theorems together with
illustrative and other descriptive material. This is followed by graded sets of solved and supplementary
problems. The solved problems serve to illustrate and amplify the theory, and to provide the repetition of basic
principles so vital to effective learning. Numerous proofs, especially those of all essential theorems, are
included among the solved problems. The supplementary problems serve as a complete review of the material
of each chapter.
The ﬁrst three chapters treat vectors in Euclidean space, matrix algebra, and systems of linear equations.
These chapters provide the motivation and basic computational tools for the abstract investigations of vector
spaces and linear mappings which follow. After chapters on inner product spaces and orthogonality and on
determinants, there is a detailed discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors giving conditions for representing
a linear operator by a diagonal matrix. This naturally leads to the study of various canonical forms,
speciﬁcally, the triangular, Jordan, and rational canonical forms. Later chapters cover linear functions and
the dual space V*, and bilinear, quadratic, and Hermitian forms. The last chapter treats linear operators on
inner product spaces.
The main changes in the fourth edition have been in the appendices. First of all, we have expanded
Appendix A on the tensor and exterior products of vector spaces where we have now included proofs on the
existence and uniqueness of such products. We also added appendices covering algebraic structures, including
modules, and polynomials over a ﬁeld. Appendix D, ‘‘Odds and Ends,’’ includes the Moore–Penrose
generalized inverse which appears in various applications, such as statistics. There are also many additional
solved and supplementary problems.
Finally, we wish to thank the staff of the McGraw-Hill Schaum’s Outline Series, especially Charles Wall,
for their unfailing cooperation.

1.1

Introduction

There are two ways to motivate the notion of a vector: one is by means of lists of numbers and subscripts,
and the other is by means of certain objects in physics. We discuss these two ways below.
Here we assume the reader is familiar with the elementary properties of the ﬁeld of real numbers,
denoted by R. On the other hand, we will review properties of the ﬁeld of complex numbers, denoted by
C. In the context of vectors, the elements of our number ﬁelds are called scalars.
Although we will restrict ourselves in this chapter to vectors whose elements come from R and then
from C, many of our operations also apply to vectors whose entries come from some arbitrary ﬁeld K.

Lists of Numbers
Suppose the weights (in pounds) of eight students are listed as follows:
156;

125;

145;

134;

178;

145;

162;

193

One can denote all the values in the list using only one symbol, say w, but with different subscripts; that is,
w1 ;

w2 ;

w3 ;

w4 ;

w5 ;

w6 ;

w7 ;

w8

Observe that each subscript denotes the position of the value in the list. For example,
w1 ¼ 156; the first number; w2 ¼ 125; the second number; . . .
Such a list of values,
w ¼ ðw1 ; w2 ; w3 ; . . . ; w8 Þ
is called a linear array or vector.

Vectors in Physics
Many physical quantities, such as temperature and speed, possess only ‘‘magnitude.’’ These quantities
can be represented by real numbers and are called scalars. On the other hand, there are also quantities,
such as force and velocity, that possess both ‘‘magnitude’’ and ‘‘direction.’’ These quantities, which can
be represented by arrows having appropriate lengths and directions and emanating from some given
reference point O, are called vectors.
Now we assume the reader is familiar with the space R3 where all the points in space are represented
by ordered triples of real numbers. Suppose the origin of the axes in R3 is chosen as the reference point O
for the vectors discussed above. Then every vector is uniquely determined by the coordinates of its
endpoint, and vice versa.
There are two important operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication, associated with vectors
in physics. The deﬁnition of these operations and the relationship between these operations and the
endpoints of the vectors are as follows.

Figure 1-1

(i) Vector Addition: The resultant u þ v of two vectors u and v is obtained by the parallelogram law;
that is, u þ v is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by u and v. Furthermore, if ða; b; cÞ and
ða0 ; b0 ; c0 Þ are the endpoints of the vectors u and v, then ða þ a0 ; b þ b0 ; c þ c0 Þ is the endpoint of the
vector u þ v. These properties are pictured in Fig. 1-1(a).
(ii) Scalar Multiplication: The product ku of a vector u by a real number k is obtained by multiplying
the magnitude of u by k and retaining the same direction if k > 0 or the opposite direction if k < 0.
Also, if ða; b; cÞ is the endpoint of the vector u, then ðka; kb; kcÞ is the endpoint of the vector ku.
These properties are pictured in Fig. 1-1(b).
Mathematically, we identify the vector u with its ða; b; cÞ and write u ¼ ða; b; cÞ. Moreover, we call
the ordered triple ða; b; cÞ of real numbers a point or vector depending upon its interpretation. We
generalize this notion and call an n-tuple ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ of real numbers a vector. However, special
notation may be used for the vectors in R3 called spatial vectors (Section 1.6).

1.2

Vectors in Rn

The set of all n-tuples of real numbers, denoted by Rn , is called n-space. A particular n-tuple in Rn , say
u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ
is called a point or vector. The numbers ai are called the coordinates, components, entries, or elements
of u. Moreover, when discussing the space Rn , we use the term scalar for the elements of R.
Two vectors, u and v, are equal, written u ¼ v, if they have the same number of components and if the
corresponding components are equal. Although the vectors ð1; 2; 3Þ and ð2; 3; 1Þ contain the same three
numbers, these vectors are not equal because corresponding entries are not equal.
The vector ð0; 0; . . . ; 0Þ whose entries are all 0 is called the zero vector and is usually denoted by 0.
EXAMPLE 1.1

(a) The following are vectors:

ð2; 5Þ;

ð7; 9Þ;

ð0; 0; 0Þ;

ð3; 4; 5Þ

The ﬁrst two vectors belong to R2 , whereas the last two belong to R3 . The third is the zero vector in R3 .
(b) Find x; y; z such that ðx  y; x þ y; z  1Þ ¼ ð4; 2; 3Þ.
By deﬁnition of equality of vectors, corresponding entries must be equal. Thus,

x  y ¼ 4;

x þ y ¼ 2;

z1¼3

Solving the above system of equations yields x ¼ 3, y ¼ 1, z ¼ 4.

CHAPTER 1 Vectors in Rn and Cn, Spatial Vectors

Column Vectors
Sometimes a vector in n-space Rn is written vertically rather than horizontally. Such a vector is called a
column vector, and, in this context, the horizontally written vectors in Example 1.1 are called row
vectors. For example, the following are column vectors with 2; 2; 3, and 3 components, respectively:
2
3 2 1:5 3

  
1
1
3
6
27
;
; 4 5 5; 4
35
2
4
6
15
We also note that any operation deﬁned for row vectors is deﬁned analogously for column vectors.

1.3

Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication

Consider two vectors u and v in Rn , say
u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ

and

v ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ

Their sum, written u þ v, is the vector obtained by adding corresponding components from u and v. That is,
u þ v ¼ ða1 þ b1 ; a2 þ b2 ; . . . ; an þ bn Þ
The scalar product or, simply, product, of the vector u by a real number k, written ku, is the vector
obtained by multiplying each component of u by k. That is,
ku ¼ kða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ ¼ ðka1 ; ka2 ; . . . ; kan Þ
Observe that u þ v and ku are also vectors in Rn . The sum of vectors with different numbers of
components is not deﬁned.
Negatives and subtraction are deﬁned in Rn as follows:
u ¼ ð1Þu

and

u  v ¼ u þ ðvÞ

The vector u is called the negative of u, and u  v is called the difference of u and v.
Now suppose we are given vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um in Rn and scalars k1 ; k2 ; . . . ; km in R. We can
multiply the vectors by the corresponding scalars and then add the resultant scalar products to form the
vector
v ¼ k1 u1 þ k2 u2 þ k3 u3 þ    þ km um
Such a vector v is called a linear combination of the vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um .
EXAMPLE 1.2

(a) Let u ¼ ð2; 4; 5Þ and v ¼ ð1; 6; 9Þ. Then

u þ v ¼ ð2 þ 1; 4 þ ð5Þ; 5 þ 9Þ ¼ ð3; 1; 4Þ
7u ¼ ð7ð2Þ; 7ð4Þ; 7ð5ÞÞ ¼ ð14; 28; 35Þ
v ¼ ð1Þð1; 6; 9Þ ¼ ð1; 6; 9Þ
3u  5v ¼ ð6; 12; 15Þ þ ð5; 30; 45Þ ¼ ð1; 42; 60Þ
(b) The zero vector 0 ¼ ð0; 0; . . . ; 0Þ in Rn is similar to the scalar 0 in that, for any vector u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ.

u þ 0 ¼ ða1 þ 0; a2 þ 0; . . . ; an þ 0Þ ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ ¼ u

Basic properties of vectors under the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are
described in the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.1:

For any vectors u; v; w in Rn and any scalars k; k 0 in R,
(i)

ðu þ vÞ þ w ¼ u þ ðv þ wÞ,

(v)

kðu þ vÞ ¼ ku þ kv,

(ii)

u þ 0 ¼ u;

(vi)

ðk þ k 0 Þu ¼ ku þ k 0 u,

(iii) u þ ðuÞ ¼ 0;

(vii)

(kk’)u=k(k’u);

(iv)

u þ v ¼ v þ u,

(viii) 1u ¼ u.

We postpone the proof of Theorem 1.1 until Chapter 2, where it appears in the context of matrices
(Problem 2.3).
Suppose u and v are vectors in Rn for which u ¼ kv for some nonzero scalar k in R. Then u is called a
multiple of v. Also, u is said to be in the same or opposite direction as v according to whether k > 0 or
k < 0.

1.4

Dot (Inner) Product

Consider arbitrary vectors u and v in Rn ; say,
u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ

and

v ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ

The dot product or inner product or scalar product of u and v is denoted and deﬁned by
u  v ¼ a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ    þ an bn
That is, u  v is obtained by multiplying corresponding components and adding the resulting products.
The vectors u and v are said to be orthogonal (or perpendicular) if their dot product is zero—that is, if
u  v ¼ 0.
EXAMPLE 1.3

(a) Let u ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, v ¼ ð4; 5; 1Þ, w ¼ ð2; 7; 4Þ. Then,

u  v ¼ 1ð4Þ  2ð5Þ þ 3ð1Þ ¼ 4  10  3 ¼ 9
u  w ¼ 2  14 þ 12 ¼ 0;

v  w ¼ 8 þ 35  4 ¼ 39

Thus, u and w are orthogonal.

(b) Let u ¼ 4 3 5 and v ¼ 4 1 5. Then u  v ¼ 6  3 þ 8 ¼ 11.
2
4
(c) Suppose u ¼ ð1; 2; 3; 4Þ and v ¼ ð6; k; 8; 2Þ. Find k so that u and v are orthogonal.
First obtain u  v ¼ 6 þ 2k  24 þ 8 ¼ 10 þ 2k. Then set u  v ¼ 0 and solve for k:

10 þ 2k ¼ 0

or

2k ¼ 10

or

k¼5

Basic properties of the dot product in Rn (proved in Problem 1.13) follow.
THEOREM 1.2:

For any vectors u; v; w in Rn and any scalar k in R:
(i) ðu þ vÞ  w ¼ u  w þ v  w;

(iii)

u  v ¼ v  u,

(ii) ðkuÞ  v ¼ kðu  vÞ,

(iv) u  u  0; and u  u ¼ 0 iff u ¼ 0.

Note that (ii) says that we can ‘‘take k out’’ from the ﬁrst position in an inner product. By (iii) and (ii),
u  ðkvÞ ¼ ðkvÞ  u ¼ kðv  uÞ ¼ kðu  vÞ

CHAPTER 1 Vectors in Rn and Cn, Spatial Vectors

5

That is, we can also ‘‘take k out’’ from the second position in an inner product.
The space Rn with the above operations of vector addition, scalar multiplication, and dot product is
usually called Euclidean n-space.

Norm (Length) of a Vector
The norm or length of a vector u in Rn , denoted by kuk, is deﬁned to be the nonnegative square root of
u  u. In particular, if u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ, then
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kuk ¼ u  u ¼ a21 þ a22 þ    þ a2n
That is, kuk is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components of u. Thus, kuk  0, and
kuk ¼ 0 if and only if u ¼ 0.
A vector u is called a unit vector if kuk ¼ 1 or, equivalently, if u  u ¼ 1. For any nonzero vector v in
Rn , the vector
1
v
v¼
v^ ¼
kvk
kvk
is the unique unit vector in the same direction as v. The process of ﬁnding v^ from v is called normalizing v.
EXAMPLE 1.4

(a) Suppose u ¼ ð1; 2; 4; 5; 3Þ. To ﬁnd kuk, we can ﬁrst ﬁnd kuk2 ¼ u  u by squaring each component of u and
adding, as follows:

kuk2 ¼ 12 þ ð2Þ2 þ ð4Þ2 þ 52 þ 32 ¼ 1 þ 4 þ 16 þ 25 þ 9 ¼ 55
Then kuk ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
55.

(b) Let v ¼ ð1; 3; 4; 2Þ and w ¼ ð12 ;  16 ; 56 ; 16Þ. Then

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kvk ¼ 1 þ 9 þ 16 þ 4 ¼ 30

and

kwk ¼

Thus w is a unit vector, but v is not a unit vector. However, we can normalize v as follows:

v

v^ ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ; pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ; pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ; pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
30 30 30 30

This is the unique unit vector in the same direction as v.

The following formula (proved in Problem 1.14) is known as the Schwarz inequality or Cauchy–
Schwarz inequality. It is used in many branches of mathematics.
THEOREM 1.3

(Schwarz): For any vectors u; v in Rn , ju  vj  kukkvk.

Using the above inequality, we also prove (Problem 1.15) the following result known as the ‘‘triangle
inequality’’ or Minkowski’s inequality.
THEOREM 1.4

(Minkowski): For any vectors u; v in Rn , ku þ vk  kuk þ kvk.

Distance, Angles, Projections
The distance between vectors u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ and v ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ in Rn is denoted and deﬁned
by
qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
dðu; vÞ ¼ ku  vk ¼ ða1  b1 Þ2 þ ða2  b2 Þ2 þ    þ ðan  bn Þ2
One can show that this deﬁnition agrees with the usual notion of distance in the Euclidean plane R2 or
space R3 .

CHAPTER 1 Vectors in Rn and Cn, Spatial Vectors

The angle y between nonzero vectors u; v in Rn is deﬁned by
uv
cos y ¼
kukkvk
This deﬁnition is well deﬁned, because, by the Schwarz inequality (Theorem 1.3),
uv
1
1 
kukkvk
Note that if u  v ¼ 0, then y ¼ 90 (or y ¼ p=2). This then agrees with our previous deﬁnition of
orthogonality.
The projection of a vector u onto a nonzero vector v is the vector denoted and deﬁned by
uv
uv

We show below that this agrees with the usual notion of vector projection in physics.
EXAMPLE 1.5

(a) Suppose u ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ and v ¼ ð2; 4; 5Þ. Then

qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
dðu; vÞ ¼ ð1  2Þ2 þ ð2  4Þ2 þ ð3  5Þ2 ¼ 1 þ 36 þ 4 ¼ 41

Located Vectors, Hyperplanes, Lines, Curves in Rn

This section distinguishes between an n-tuple Pðai Þ  Pða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ viewed as a point in Rn and an
n-tuple u ¼ ½c1 ; c2 ; . . . ; cn  viewed as a vector (arrow) from the origin O to the point Cðc1 ; c2 ; . . . ; cn Þ.

Located Vectors
Any pair of points Aðai Þ and Bðbi Þ in Rn deﬁnes the located vector or directed line segment from A to B,
!
!
written AB . We identify AB with the vector
u ¼ B  A ¼ ½b1  a1 ; b2  a2 ; . . . ; bn  an 
!
because AB and u have the same magnitude and direction. This is pictured in Fig. 1-2(b) for the
points Aða1 ; a2 ; a3 Þ and Bðb1 ; b2 ; b3 Þ in R3 and the vector u ¼ B  A which has the endpoint
Pðb1  a1 , b2  a2 , b3  a3 Þ.

Hyperplanes
A hyperplane H in Rn is the set of points ðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ that satisfy a linear equation
a1 x1 þ a2 x2 þ    þ an xn ¼ b
where the vector u ¼ ½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an  of coefﬁcients is not zero. Thus a hyperplane H in R2 is a line, and a
3
hyperplane H in R3 is a plane.
! We show below, as pictured in Fig. 1-3(a) for R , that u is orthogonal to
any directed line segment PQ , where Pð pi Þ and Qðqi Þ are points in H: [For this reason, we say that u is
normal to H and that H is normal to u:]

Figure 1-3

Because Pð pi Þ and Qðqi Þ belong to H; they satisfy the above hyperplane equation—that is,
a1 p1 þ a2 p2 þ    þ an pn ¼ b and a1 q1 þ a2 q2 þ    þ an qn ¼ b
!
Let v ¼ PQ ¼ Q  P ¼ ½q1  p1 ; q2  p2 ; . . . ; qn  pn 
Then
u  v ¼ a1 ðq1  p1 Þ þ a2 ðq2  p2 Þ þ    þ an ðqn  pn Þ
¼ ða1 q1 þ a2 q2 þ    þ an qn Þ  ða1 p1 þ a2 p2 þ    þ an pn Þ ¼ b  b ¼ 0
!
Thus v ¼ PQ is orthogonal to u; as claimed.

Lines in Rn

The line L in Rn passing through the point Pðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ and in the direction of a nonzero vector
u ¼ ½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an  consists of the points X ðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ that satisfy

xn ¼ an t þ bn
where the parameter t takes on all real values. Such a line L in R3 is pictured in Fig. 1-3(b).
EXAMPLE 1.6

(a) Let H be the plane in R3 corresponding to the linear equation 2x  5y þ 7z ¼ 4. Observe that Pð1; 1; 1Þ and
Qð5; 4; 2Þ are solutions of the equation. Thus P and Q and the directed line segment
!
v ¼ PQ ¼ Q  P ¼ ½5  1; 4  1; 2  1 ¼ ½4; 3; 1
lie on the plane H. The vector u ¼ ½2; 5; 7 is normal to H, and, as expected,

u  v ¼ ½2; 5; 7  ½4; 3; 1 ¼ 8  15 þ 7 ¼ 0
That is, u is orthogonal to v.
(b) Find an equation of the hyperplane H in R4 that passes through the point Pð1; 3; 4; 2Þ and is normal to the
vector u ¼ ½4; 2; 5; 6.
The coefﬁcients of the unknowns of an equation of H are the components of the normal vector u; hence, the
equation of H must be of the form
4x1  2x2 þ 5x3 þ 6x4 ¼ k
Substituting P into this equation, we obtain
4ð1Þ  2ð3Þ þ 5ð4Þ þ 6ð2Þ ¼ k

or

4  6  20 þ 12 ¼ k

or

k ¼ 10

Thus, 4x1  2x2 þ 5x3 þ 6x4 ¼ 10 is the equation of H.
(c) Find the parametric representation of the line L in R4 passing through the point Pð1; 2; 3; 4Þ and in the
direction of u ¼ ½5; 6; 7; 8. Also, ﬁnd the point Q on L when t ¼ 1.
Substitution in the above equation for L yields the following parametric representation:

x1 ¼ 5t þ 1;

x2 ¼ 6t þ 2;

x3 ¼ 7t þ 3;

x4 ¼ 8t  4

or, equivalently,
LðtÞ ¼ ð5t þ 1; 6t þ 2; 7t þ 3; 8t  4Þ
Note that t ¼ 0 yields the point P on L. Substitution of t ¼ 1 yields the point Qð6; 8; 4; 4Þ on L.

Curves in Rn
Let D be an interval (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) on the real line R. A continuous function F: D ! Rn is a curve in
Rn . Thus, to each point t 2 D there is assigned the following point in Rn :
FðtÞ ¼ ½F1 ðtÞ; F2 ðtÞ; . . . ; Fn ðtÞ
Moreover, the derivative (if it exists) of FðtÞ yields the vector

which is tangent to the curve. Normalizing V ðtÞ yields

TðtÞ ¼

Thus, TðtÞ is the unit tangent vector to the curve. (Unit vectors with geometrical signiﬁcance are often
presented in bold type.)
Consider the curve FðtÞ ¼ ½sin t; cos t; t in R3 . Taking the derivative of FðtÞ [or each component of

EXAMPLE 1.7

FðtÞ] yields

V ðtÞ ¼ ½cos t;  sin t; 1
which is a vector tangent to the curve. We normalize V ðtÞ. First we obtain

kV ðtÞk2 ¼ cos2 t þ sin2 t þ 1 ¼ 1 þ 1 ¼ 2
Then the unit tangent vection TðtÞ to the curve follows:

Vectors in R3 (Spatial Vectors), ijk Notation

Vectors in R3 , called spatial vectors, appear in many applications, especially in physics. In fact, a special
notation is frequently used for such vectors as follows:
i ¼ ½1; 0; 0 denotes the unit vector in the x direction:
j ¼ ½0; 1; 0 denotes the unit vector in the y direction:
k ¼ ½0; 0; 1 denotes the unit vector in the z direction:
Then any vector u ¼ ½a; b; c in R3 can be expressed uniquely in the form
u ¼ ½a; b; c ¼ ai þ bj þ cj
Because the vectors i; j; k are unit vectors and are mutually orthogonal, we obtain the following dot
products:
i  i ¼ 1;

j  j ¼ 1;

kk ¼1

and

i  j ¼ 0;

i  k ¼ 0;

jk ¼0

Furthermore, the vector operations discussed above may be expressed in the ijk notation as follows.
Suppose
u ¼ a1 i þ a2 j þ a3 k

and

v ¼ b1 i þ b2 j þ b3 k

Then
u þ v ¼ ða1 þ b1 Þi þ ða2 þ b2 Þj þ ða3 þ b3 Þk
where c is a scalar. Also,

(b) To ﬁnd 3u  2v, ﬁrst multiply by the scalars and then add:

Cross Product
There is a special operation for vectors u and v in R3 that is not deﬁned in Rn for n 6¼ 3. This operation is
called the cross product and is denoted by u v. One way to easily remember the formula for u v is to
use the determinant (of order two) and its negative, which are denoted and deﬁned as follows:




a b
a b

 ¼ ad  bc


and

c d
 c d  ¼ bc  ad
Here a and d are called the diagonal elements and b and c are the nondiagonal elements. Thus, the
determinant is the product ad of the diagonal elements minus the product bc of the nondiagonal elements,
but vice versa for the negative of the determinant.
Now suppose u ¼ a1 i þ a2 j þ a3 k and v ¼ b1 i þ b2 j þ b3 k. Then
v ¼ ða2 b3  a3 b2 Þi þ ða3 b1  a1 b3 Þj þ ða1 b2  a2 b1 Þk

Remark: The cross products of the vectors i; j; k are as follows:
i
j

j ¼ k;
i ¼ k;

j
k

k ¼ i;
j ¼ i;

k i¼j
i k ¼ j

Thus, if we view the triple ði; j; kÞ as a cyclic permutation, where i follows k and hence k precedes i, then
the product of two of them in the given direction is the third one, but the product of two of them in the
opposite direction is the negative of the third one.
Two important properties of the cross product are contained in the following theorem.

where y is the angle between u and v.

Complex Numbers

The set of complex numbers is denoted by C. Formally, a complex number is an ordered pair ða; bÞ of
real numbers where equality, addition, and multiplication are deﬁned as follows:
ða; bÞ ¼ ðc; dÞ

if and only if a ¼ c and b ¼ d

ða; bÞ þ ðc; dÞ ¼ ða þ c; b þ dÞ
ða; bÞ  ðc; dÞ ¼ ðac  bd; ad þ bcÞ
We identify the real number a with the complex number ða; 0Þ; that is,
a $ ða; 0Þ
This is possible because the operations of addition and multiplication of real numbers are preserved under
the correspondence; that is,
ða; 0Þ þ ðb; 0Þ ¼ ða þ b; 0Þ

and

ða; 0Þ  ðb; 0Þ ¼ ðab; 0Þ

Thus we view R as a subset of C, and replace ða; 0Þ by a whenever convenient and possible.
We note that the set C of complex numbers with the above operations of addition and multiplication is
a field of numbers, like the set R of real numbers and the set Q of rational numbers.

CHAPTER 1 Vectors in Rn and Cn, Spatial Vectors

The complex number ð0; 1Þ is denoted by i. It has the important property that
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
i2 ¼ ii ¼ ð0; 1Þð0; 1Þ ¼ ð1; 0Þ ¼ 1
or
i ¼ 1
Accordingly, any complex number z ¼ ða; bÞ can be written in the form
z ¼ ða; bÞ ¼ ða; 0Þ þ ð0; bÞ ¼ ða; 0Þ þ ðb; 0Þ  ð0; 1Þ ¼ a þ bi
The above notation z ¼ a þ bi, where a  Re z and b  Im z are called, respectively, the real and
imaginary parts of z, is more convenient than ða; bÞ. In fact, the sum and product of complex numbers
z ¼ a þ bi and w ¼ c þ di can be derived by simply using the commutative and distributive laws and
i2 ¼ 1:
z þ w ¼ ða þ biÞ þ ðc þ diÞ ¼ a þ c þ bi þ di ¼ ða þ bÞ þ ðc þ dÞi
zw ¼ ða þ biÞðc þ diÞ ¼ ac þ bci þ adi þ bdi2 ¼ ðac  bdÞ þ ðbc þ adÞi
We also deﬁne the negative of z and subtraction in C by

Complex Conjugate, Absolute Value
Consider a complex number z ¼ a þ bi. The conjugate of z is denoted and deﬁned by
z ¼ a þ bi ¼ a  bi
Then z
z ¼ ða þ biÞða  biÞ ¼ a2  b2 i2 ¼ a2 þ b2 . Note that z is real if and only if z ¼ z.
The absolute value of z, denoted by jzj, is deﬁned to be the nonnegative square root of z
z. Namely,
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
jzj ¼ z
z ¼ a2 þ b2
Note that jzj is equal to the norm of the vector ða; bÞ in R2 .

Complex Plane
Recall that the real numbers R can be represented by points on a line. Analogously, the complex numbers
C can be represented by points in the plane. Speciﬁcally, we let the point ða; bÞ in the plane represent the
complex number a þ bi as shown in Fig. 1-4(b). In such a case, jzj is the distance from the origin O to the
point z. The plane with this representation is called the complex plane, just like the line representing R is
called the real line.

Vectors in Cn

The set of all n-tuples of complex numbers, denoted by Cn , is called complex n-space. Just as in the real
case, the elements of Cn are called points or vectors, the elements of C are called scalars, and vector
addition in Cn and scalar multiplication on Cn are given by
½z1 ; z2 ; . . . ; zn  þ ½w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn  ¼ ½z1 þ w1 ; z2 þ w2 ; . . . ; zn þ wn 
z½z1 ; z2 ; . . . ; zn  ¼ ½zz1 ; zz2 ; . . . ; zzn 
where the zi , wi , and z belong to C.
EXAMPLE 1.11 Consider vectors u ¼ ½2 þ 3i; 4  i; 3 and v ¼ ½3  2i; 5i; 4  6i in C3 . Then

u þ v ¼ ½2 þ 3i; 4  i; 3 þ ½3  2i; 5i; 4  6i ¼ ½5 þ i; 4 þ 4i; 7  6i

Dot (Inner) Product in Cn
Consider vectors u ¼ ½z1 ; z2 ; . . . ; zn  and v ¼ ½w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn  in Cn . The dot or inner product of u and v is
denoted and deﬁned by
1 þ z2 w

The space Cn with the above operations of vector addition, scalar multiplication, and dot product, is
called complex Euclidean n-space. Theorem 1.2 for Rn also holds for Cn if we replace u  v ¼ v  u by
uv ¼uv
On the other hand, the Schwarz inequality (Theorem 1.3) and Minkowski’s inequality (Theorem 1.4) are
true for Cn with no changes.

Let a ¼ kuk2 , b ¼ 2ðu  vÞ, c ¼ kvk2 . Then, for every value of t, at2 þ bt þ c  0. This means that the
quadratic polynomial cannot have two real roots. This implies that the discriminant D ¼ b2  4ac  0 or,
equivalently, b2  4ac. Thus,

Dividing by 4 gives us our result.

u ¼ ½2; 5; 6; 3.
The coefﬁcients of the unknowns of an equation of H are the components of the normal vector u. Thus, an
equation of H is of the form 2x1 þ 5x2  6x3  3x4 ¼ k. Substitute P into this equation to obtain k ¼ 26.
Thus, an equation of H is 2x1 þ 5x2  6x3  3x4 ¼ 26.

1.18. Find an equation of the plane H in R3 that contains Pð1; 3; 4Þ and is parallel to the plane H 0
determined by the equation 3x  6y þ 5z ¼ 2.
The planes H and H 0 are parallel if and only if their normal directions are parallel or antiparallel (opposite
direction). Hence, an equation of H is of the form 3x  6y þ 5z ¼ k. Substitute P into this equation to obtain
k ¼ 1. Then an equation of H is 3x  6y þ 5z ¼ 1.

where the parameter t takes on all real values. Thus we obtain

(b) Find the initial point Q and terminal point Q 0 of C.
(c) Find the unit tangent vector T to the curve C when t ¼ 2.
(a) Substitute t ¼ 2 into FðtÞ to get P ¼ f ð2Þ ¼ ð4; 4; 8; 9Þ.
(b) The parameter t ranges from t ¼ 0 to t ¼ 4. Hence, Q ¼ f ð0Þ ¼ ð0; 2; 0; 5Þ and
Q 0 ¼ Fð4Þ ¼ ð16; 10; 64; 21Þ.

LðtÞ ¼ ðt þ 1; 2t þ 3; 8t þ 2Þ ¼ ðt þ 1Þi þ ð2t þ 3Þj þ ð8t þ 2Þk
(b) Because L is perpendicular to H, the line L is in the same direction as the normal vector
N ¼ 3i þ 5j þ 7k to H. Thus,

CHAPTER 1 Vectors in Rn and Cn, Spatial Vectors

19

(a) The formula for the normal vector to a surface Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ 0 is
Nðx; y; zÞ ¼ Fx i þ Fy j þ Fz k
where Fx , Fy , Fz are the partial derivatives. Using Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ xy2 þ 2yz  16, we obtain
Fx ¼ y2 ;

Fy ¼ 2xy þ 2z;

Fz ¼ 2y

Thus, Nðx; y; zÞ ¼ y i þ ð2xy þ 2zÞj þ 2yk.
(b) The normal to the surface S at the point P is
2

NðPÞ ¼ Nð1; 2; 3Þ ¼ 4i þ 10j þ 4k
Hence, N ¼ 2i þ 5j þ 2k is also normal to S at P. Thus an equation of H has the form 2x þ 5y þ 2z ¼ c.
Substitute P in this equation to obtain c ¼ 18. Thus the tangent plane H to S at P is 2x þ 5y þ 2z ¼ 18.

Algebra of Matrices
2.1

Introduction

This chapter investigates matrices and algebraic operations deﬁned on them. These matrices may be
viewed as rectangular arrays of elements where each entry depends on two subscripts (as compared with
vectors, where each entry depended on only one subscript). Systems of linear equations and their
solutions (Chapter 3) may be efﬁciently investigated using the language of matrices. Furthermore, certain
abstract objects introduced in later chapters, such as ‘‘change of basis,’’ ‘‘linear transformations,’’ and
‘‘quadratic forms,’’ can be represented by these matrices (rectangular arrays). On the other hand, the
abstract treatment of linear algebra presented later on will give us new insight into the structure of these
matrices.
The entries in our matrices will come from some arbitrary, but ﬁxed, ﬁeld K. The elements of K are
called numbers or scalars. Nothing essential is lost if the reader assumes that K is the real ﬁeld R.

2.2

Matrices

A matrix A over a ﬁeld K or, simply, a matrix A (when K is implicit) is a rectangular array of scalars
usually presented in the following form:
2

a11 a12 . . . a1n
6 a21 a22 . . . a2n 7
7
A¼6
4     5
am1 am2 . . . amn
The rows of such a matrix A are the m horizontal lists of scalars:
ða11 ; a12 ; . . . ; a1n Þ;

ða21 ; a22 ; . . . ; a2n Þ;

...;

ðam1 ; am2 ; . . . ; amn Þ

and the columns of A are the n vertical lists of scalars:

4 . . . 5; 4 . . . 5; . . . ; 4 . . . 5
am1
am2
amn
Note that the element aij , called the ij-entry or ij-element, appears in row i and column j. We frequently
denote such a matrix by simply writing A ¼ ½aij .
A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m by n matrix, written m n. The pair of numbers m
and n is called the size of the matrix. Two matrices A and B are equal, written A ¼ B, if they have the
same size and if corresponding elements are equal. Thus, the equality of two m n matrices is equivalent
to a system of mn equalities, one for each corresponding pair of elements.
A matrix with only one row is called a row matrix or row vector, and a matrix with only one column is
called a column matrix or column vector. A matrix whose entries are all zero is called a zero matrix and
will usually be denoted by 0.

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices

Matrices whose entries are all real numbers are called real matrices and are said to be matrices over R.
Analogously, matrices whose entries are all complex numbers are called complex matrices and are said to
be matrices over C. This text will be mainly concerned with such real and complex matrices.

By deﬁnition of equality of matrices, the four corresponding entries must be equal. Thus,
x þ y ¼ 3;

x  y ¼ 1;

2z þ t ¼ 7;

zt ¼5

Solving the above system of equations yields x ¼ 2, y ¼ 1, z ¼ 4, t ¼ 1.

2.3

Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication

Let A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  be two matrices with the same size, say m n matrices. The sum of A and B,
written A þ B, is the matrix obtained by adding corresponding elements from A and B. That is,
2

5

amn þ bmn

The product of the matrix A by a scalar k, written k  A or simply kA, is the matrix obtained by
multiplying each element of A by k. That is,
2

kA ¼ 6

Observe that A þ B and kA are also m
A ¼ ð1ÞA

and

n matrices. We also deﬁne

A  B ¼ A þ ðBÞ

The matrix A is called the negative of the matrix A, and the matrix A  B is called the difference of A
and B. The sum of matrices with different sizes is not deﬁned.

Basic properties of matrices under the operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication follow.
THEOREM 2.1: Consider any matrices A; B; C (with the same size) and any scalars k and k 0 . Then

(i)

ðA þ BÞ þ C ¼ A þ ðB þ CÞ, (v)

kðA þ BÞ ¼ kA þ kB,

(ii)

A þ 0 ¼ 0 þ A ¼ A,

(vi)

ðk þ k 0 ÞA ¼ kA þ k 0 A,

(iii) A þ ðAÞ ¼ ðAÞ þ A ¼ 0;

(vii)

ðkk 0 ÞA ¼ kðk 0 AÞ,

(iv)

A þ B ¼ B þ A,

(viii) 1  A ¼ A.

Note ﬁrst that the 0 in (ii) and (iii) refers to the zero matrix. Also, by (i) and (iv), any sum of matrices
A1 þ A2 þ    þ An
requires no parentheses, and the sum does not depend on the order of the matrices. Furthermore, using
(vi) and (viii), we also have
A þ A ¼ 2A;

A þ A þ A ¼ 3A;

...

and so on.
The proof of Theorem 2.1 reduces to showing that the ij-entries on both sides of each matrix equation
are equal. (See Problem 2.3.)
Observe the similarity between Theorem 2.1 for matrices and Theorem 1.1 for vectors. In fact, the
above operations for matrices may be viewed as generalizations of the corresponding operations for
vectors.

2.4

Summation Symbol

Before we deﬁne matrix multiplication, it will be instructive to ﬁrst introduce the summation symbol S
(the Greek capital letter sigma).
Suppose f ðkÞ is an algebraic expression involving the letter k. Then the expression
n
P

f ðkÞ

k¼1

or equivalently

Pn

k¼1 f ðkÞ

has the following meaning. First we set k ¼ 1 in f ðkÞ, obtaining
f ð1Þ
Then we set k ¼ 2 in f ðkÞ, obtaining f ð2Þ, and add this to f ð1Þ, obtaining
f ð1Þ þ f ð2Þ

30

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices

Then we set k ¼ 3 in f ðkÞ, obtaining f ð3Þ, and add this to the previous sum, obtaining
f ð1Þ þ f ð2Þ þ f ð3Þ
We continue this process until we obtain the sum
f ð1Þ þ f ð2Þ þ    þ f ðnÞ
Observe that at each step we increase the value of k by 1 until we reach n. The letter k is called the index,
and 1 and n are called, respectively, the lower and upper limits. Other letters frequently used as indices
are i and j.
We also generalize our deﬁnition by allowing the sum to range from any integer n1 to any integer n2 .
That is, we deﬁne

Matrix Multiplication

The product of matrices A and B, written AB, is somewhat complicated. For this reason, we ﬁrst begin
with a special case.
The product AB of a row matrix A ¼ ½ai  and a column matrix B ¼ ½bi  with the same number of
elements is deﬁned to be the scalar (or 1 1 matrix) obtained by multiplying corresponding entries and
adding; that is,

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices

Suppose A ¼ ½aik  and B ¼ ½bkj  are matrices such that the number of columns of A is
equal to the number of rows of B; say, A is an m p matrix and B is a p n matrix.
Then the product AB is the m n matrix whose ij-entry is obtained by multiplying the
ith row of A by the jth column of B. That is,

Because A is 2 2 and B is 2 3, the product AB is deﬁned and AB is a 2 3 matrix. To obtain
the ﬁrst row of the product matrix AB, multiply the ﬁrst row [1, 3] of A by each column of B,

THEOREM 2.2: Let A; B; C be matrices. Then, whenever the products and sums are deﬁned,

(i)

ðABÞC ¼ AðBCÞ (associative law),

(ii)

AðB þ CÞ ¼ AB þ AC (left distributive law),

(iii)

ðB þ CÞA ¼ BA þ CA (right distributive law),

(iv)

kðABÞ ¼ ðkAÞB ¼ AðkBÞ, where k is a scalar.

We note that 0A ¼ 0 and B0 ¼ 0, where 0 is the zero matrix.

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices

Transpose of a Matrix

The transpose of a matrix A, written AT , is the matrix obtained by writing the columns of A, in order, as
rows. For example, 2
3
2


T
1 4
1
1 2 3
¼ 42 55
and
½1; 3; 5T ¼ 4 3 5
4 5 6
3 6
5
In other words, if A ¼ ½aij  is an m

n matrix, then AT ¼ ½bij  is the n

m matrix where bij ¼ aji .

Observe that the tranpose of a row vector is a column vector. Similarly, the transpose of a column
vector is a row vector.
The next theorem lists basic properties of the transpose operation.
THEOREM 2.3: Let A and B be matrices and let k be a scalar. Then, whenever the sum and product are

deﬁned,
(i)

ðA þ BÞT ¼ AT þ BT ,

(iii)

(ii) ðAT ÞT ¼ A;

ðkAÞT ¼ kAT ,

(iv) ðABÞT ¼ BT AT .

We emphasize that, by (iv), the transpose of a product is the product of the transposes, but in the
reverse order.

2.7

Square Matrices

A square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows as columns. An n n square matrix is said to
be of order n and is sometimes called an n-square matrix.
Recall that not every two matrices can be added or multiplied. However, if we only consider square
matrices of some given order n, then this inconvenience disappears. Speciﬁcally, the operations of
addition, multiplication, scalar multiplication, and transpose can be performed on any n n matrices, and
the result is again an n n matrix.

Diagonal and Trace
Let A ¼ ½aij  be an n-square matrix. The diagonal or main diagonal of A consists of the elements with the
same subscripts—that is,
a11 ;

a22 ;

a33 ;

...;

ann

33

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices
The trace of A, written trðAÞ, is the sum of the diagonal elements. Namely,
trðAÞ ¼ a11 þ a22 þ a33 þ    þ ann
The following theorem applies.
THEOREM 2.4: Suppose A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  are n-square matrices and k is a scalar. Then

(i)

trðA þ BÞ ¼ trðAÞ þ trðBÞ,

(ii) trðkAÞ ¼ k trðAÞ,

(iii)

trðAT Þ ¼ trðAÞ,

(iv)

trðABÞ ¼ trðBAÞ.

EXAMPLE 2.7 Let A and B be the matrices A and B in Example 2.6. Then

diagonal of A ¼ f1; 4; 7g

and

trðAÞ ¼ 1  4 þ 7 ¼ 4

diagonal of B ¼ f2; 3; 4g

and

trðBÞ ¼ 2 þ 3  4 ¼ 1

Moreover,
trðA þ BÞ ¼ 3  1 þ 3 ¼ 5;

trð2AÞ ¼ 2  8 þ 14 ¼ 8;

trðABÞ ¼ 5 þ 0  35 ¼ 30;

trðBAÞ ¼ 27  24  33 ¼ 30

trðAT Þ ¼ 1  4 þ 7 ¼ 4

As expected from Theorem 2.4,
trðA þ BÞ ¼ trðAÞ þ trðBÞ;

trðAT Þ ¼ trðAÞ;

trð2AÞ ¼ 2 trðAÞ

Furthermore, although AB 6¼ BA, the traces are equal.

Identity Matrix, Scalar Matrices
The n-square identity or unit matrix, denoted by In , or simply I, is the n-square matrix with 1’s on the
diagonal and 0’s elsewhere. The identity matrix I is similar to the scalar 1 in that, for any n-square matrix
A,
AI ¼ IA ¼ A
More generally, if B is an m n matrix, then BIn ¼ Im B ¼ B.
For any scalar k, the matrix kI that contains k’s on the diagonal and 0’s elsewhere is called the scalar
matrix corresponding to the scalar k. Observe that
ðkIÞA ¼ kðIAÞ ¼ kA
That is, multiplying a matrix A by the scalar matrix kI is equivalent to multiplying A by the scalar k.
EXAMPLE 2.8 The following are the identity matrices of orders 3 and 4 and the corresponding scalar
matrices for k ¼ 5:

Remark 1: It is common practice to omit blocks or patterns of 0’s when there is no ambiguity, as
in the above second and fourth matrices.
Remark 2:
dij ¼

0
1

The Kronecker delta function dij is deﬁned by
if i 6¼ j
if i ¼ j

Thus, the identity matrix may be deﬁned by I ¼ ½dij .

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices

Powers of Matrices, Polynomials in Matrices

Let A be an n-square matrix over a ﬁeld K. Powers of A are deﬁned as follows:
A2 ¼ AA;

A3 ¼ A2 A;

...;

Anþ1 ¼ An A;

...;

A0 ¼ I

and

Polynomials in the matrix A are also deﬁned. Speciﬁcally, for any polynomial
f ðxÞ ¼ a0 þ a1 x þ a2 x2 þ    þ an xn
where the ai are scalars in K, f ðAÞ is deﬁned to be the following matrix:
f ðAÞ ¼ a0 I þ a1 A þ a2 A2 þ    þ an An
[Note that f ðAÞ is obtained from f ðxÞ by substituting the matrix A for the variable x and substituting the
scalar matrix a0 I for the scalar a0 .] If f ðAÞ is the zero matrix, then A is called a zero or root of f ðxÞ.

Invertible (Nonsingular) Matrices

A square matrix A is said to be invertible or nonsingular if there exists a matrix B such that
AB ¼ BA ¼ I
where I is the identity matrix. Such a matrix B is unique. That is, if AB1 ¼ B1 A ¼ I and AB2 ¼ B2 A ¼ I,
then
B1 ¼ B1 I ¼ B1 ðAB2 Þ ¼ ðB1 AÞB2 ¼ IB2 ¼ B2
We call such a matrix B the inverse of A and denote it by A1 . Observe that the above relation is
symmetric; that is, if B is the inverse of A, then A is the inverse of B.

It is known (Theorem 3.16) that AB ¼ I if and only if BA ¼ I. Thus, it is necessary to test only one
product to determine whether or not two given matrices are inverses. (See Problem 2.17.)
Now suppose A and B are invertible. Then AB is invertible and ðABÞ1 ¼ B1 A1 . More generally, if
A1 ; A2 ; . . . ; Ak are invertible, then their product is invertible and

Let A be an arbitrary 2 2 matrix, say A ¼

Setting the four entries equal to the corresponding entries in the identity matrix yields four equations,
which can be partitioned into two 2 2 systems as follows:
ax1 þ by1 ¼ 1;
ax2 þ by2 ¼ 0
cx1 þ dy1 ¼ 0;
cx2 þ dy2 ¼ 1
Suppose we let jAj ¼ ab  bc (called the determinant of A). Assuming jAj 6¼ 0, we can solve uniquely for

(2) Take the negatives of the other two elements.
(3) Multiply the resulting matrix by 1=jAj or, equivalently, divide each element by jAj.
In case jAj ¼ 0, the matrix A is not invertible.

is true for square matrices of any order. (See Chapter 8.)

Inverse of an n

n Matrix

Suppose A is an arbitrary n-square matrix. Finding its inverse A1 reduces, as above, to ﬁnding the
solution of a collection of n n systems of linear equations. The solution of such systems and an efﬁcient
way of solving such a collection of systems is treated in Chapter 3.

Special Types of Square Matrices

This section describes a number of special kinds of square matrices.

Diagonal and Triangular Matrices
A square matrix D ¼ ½dij  is diagonal if its nondiagonal entries are all zero. Such a matrix is sometimes
denoted by
D ¼ diagðd11 ; d22 ; . . . ; dnn Þ

are diagonal matrices, which may be represented, respectively, by
diagð3; 7; 2Þ;

diagð4; 5Þ;

diagð6; 0; 9; 8Þ

(Observe that patterns of 0’s in the third matrix have been omitted.)
A square matrix A ¼ ½aij  is upper triangular or simply triangular if all entries below the (main)
diagonal are equal to 0—that is, if aij ¼ 0 for i > j. Generic upper triangular matrices of orders 2, 3, 4 are
as follows:

(As with diagonal matrices, it is common practice to omit patterns of 0’s.)
The following theorem applies.
THEOREM 2.5: Suppose A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  are n

(i)

A þ B, kA, AB are triangular with respective diagonals:
ða11 þ b11 ; . . . ; ann þ bnn Þ;

(ii)

n (upper) triangular matrices. Then
ðka11 ; . . . ; kann Þ;

ða11 b11 ; . . . ; ann bnn Þ

For any polynomial f ðxÞ, the matrix f ðAÞ is triangular with diagonal
ð f ða11 Þ; f ða22 Þ; . . . ; f ðann ÞÞ

(iii) A is invertible if and only if each diagonal element aii 6¼ 0, and when A1 exists
it is also triangular.
A lower triangular matrix is a square matrix whose entries above the diagonal are all zero. We note
that Theorem 2.5 is true if we replace ‘‘triangular’’ by either ‘‘lower triangular’’ or ‘‘diagonal.’’
Remark: A nonempty collection A of matrices is called an algebra (of matrices) if A is closed
under the operations of matrix addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication. Clearly, the
square matrices with a given order form an algebra of matrices, but so do the scalar, diagonal, triangular,
and lower triangular matrices.

Special Real Square Matrices: Symmetric, Orthogonal, Normal
[Optional until Chapter 12]
Suppose now A is a square matrix with real entries—that is, a real square matrix. The relationship
between A and its transpose AT yields important kinds of matrices.

(a)

Symmetric Matrices

A matrix A is symmetric if AT ¼ A. Equivalently, A ¼ ½aij  is symmetric if symmetric elements (mirror
elements with respect to the diagonal) are equal—that is, if each aij ¼ aji .
A matrix A is skew-symmetric if AT ¼ A or, equivalently, if each aij ¼ aji . Clearly, the diagonal
elements of such a matrix must be zero, because aii ¼ aii implies aii ¼ 0.
(Note that a matrix A must be square if AT ¼ A or AT ¼ A.)

(a) By inspection, the symmetric elements in A are equal, or AT ¼ A. Thus, A is symmetric.
(b) The diagonal elements of B are 0 and symmetric elements are negatives of each other, or BT ¼ B.
Thus, B is skew-symmetric.
(c) Because C is not square, C is neither symmetric nor skew-symmetric.

(b)

Orthogonal Matrices

A real matrix A is orthogonal if AT ¼ A1 —that is, if AAT ¼ AT A ¼ I. Thus, A must necessarily be
square and invertible.

8

AT A ¼ I, as well. Thus, AT ¼ A1 ; that is, A is orthogonal.
Now suppose A is a real orthogonal 3
u1 ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; a3 Þ;

3 matrix with rows

u2 ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; b3 Þ;

u3 ¼ ðc1 ; c2 ; c3 Þ

Because A is orthogonal, we must have AA ¼ I. Namely,

Multiplying A by AT and setting each entry equal to the corresponding entry in I yields the following nine
equations:
a21 þ a22 þ a23 ¼ 1;
b1 a1 þ b2 a2 þ b3 a3 ¼ 0;
c1 a1 þ c2 a2 þ c3 a3 ¼ 0;

a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ a3 b3 ¼ 0;
b21 þ b22 þ b23 ¼ 1;
c1 b1 þ c2 b2 þ c3 b3 ¼ 0;

a1 c1 þ a2 c2 þ a3 c3 ¼ 0
b1 c1 þ b2 c2 þ b3 c3 ¼ 0
c21 þ c22 þ c23 ¼ 1

Accordingly, u1  u1 ¼ 1, u2  u2 ¼ 1, u3  u3 ¼ 1, and ui  uj ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j. Thus, the rows u1 , u2 , u3 are
unit vectors and are orthogonal to each other.
Generally speaking, vectors u1 , u2 ; . . . ; um in Rn are said to form an orthonormal set of vectors if the
vectors are unit vectors and are orthogonal to each other; that is,
ui  uj ¼

0
1

if i 6¼ j
if i ¼ j

In other words, ui  uj ¼ dij where dij is the Kronecker delta function:
We have shown that the condition AAT ¼ I implies that the rows of A form an orthonormal set of
vectors. The condition AT A ¼ I similarly implies that the columns of A also form an orthonormal set
of vectors. Furthermore, because each step is reversible, the converse is true.
The above results for 3 3 matrices are true in general. That is, the following theorem holds.
THEOREM 2.6: Let A be a real matrix. Then the following are equivalent:

(a) A is orthogonal.
(b) The rows of A form an orthonormal set.
(c) The columns of A form an orthonormal set.
For n ¼ 2, we have the following result (proved in Problem 2.28).

A real matrix A is normal if it commutes with its transpose AT —that is, if AAT ¼ AT A. If A is symmetric,

Complex Matrices

Let A be a complex matrix—that is, a matrix with complex entries. Recall (Section 1.7) that if z ¼ a þ bi
 is
is a complex number, then z ¼ a  bi is its conjugate. The conjugate of a complex matrix A, written A,

the matrix obtained from A by taking the conjugate of each entry in A. That is, if A ¼ ½aij , then A ¼ ½bij ,
where bij ¼ aij . (We denote this fact by writing A ¼ ½
aij .)
The two operations of transpose and conjugation commute for any complex matrix A, and the special
notation AH is used for the conjugate transpose of A. That is,
 T ¼ ðAT Þ
AH ¼ ðAÞ
Note that if A is real, then AH ¼ AT . [Some texts use A* instead of AH :]

Special Complex Matrices: Hermitian, Unitary, Normal [Optional until Chapter 12]
Consider a complex matrix A. The relationship between A and its conjugate transpose AH yields
important kinds of complex matrices (which are analogous to the kinds of real matrices described above).
A complex matrix A is said to be Hermitian or skew-Hermitian according as to whether
AH ¼ A

or

AH ¼ A:

Clearly, A ¼ ½aij  is Hermitian if and only if symmetric elements are conjugate—that is, if each
aij ¼ aji —in which case each diagonal element aii must be real. Similarly, if A is skew-symmetric,
then each diagonal element aii ¼ 0. (Note that A must be square if AH ¼ A or AH ¼ A.)
A complex matrix A is unitary if AH A1 ¼ A1 AH ¼ I—that is, if
AH ¼ A1 :
Thus, A must necessarily be square and invertible. We note that a complex matrix A is unitary if and only
if its rows (columns) form an orthonormal set relative to the dot product of complex vectors.
A complex matrix A is said to be normal if it commutes with AH —that is, if
AAH ¼ AH A

39

(a) By inspection, the diagonal elements of A are real, and the symmetric elements 1  2i and 1 þ 2i are
conjugate, 4 þ 7i and 4  7i are conjugate, and 2i and 2i are conjugate. Thus, A is Hermitian.
(b) Multiplying B by BH yields I; that is, BBH ¼ I. This implies BH B ¼ I, as well. Thus, BH ¼ B1 ,
which means B is unitary.
(c) To show C is normal, we evaluate CC H and C H C:

We note that when a matrix A is real, Hermitian is the same as symmetric, and unitary is the same as
orthogonal.

2.12

Block Matrices

Using a system of horizontal and vertical (dashed) lines, we can partition a matrix A into submatrices
called blocks (or cells) of A. Clearly a given matrix may be divided into blocks in different ways. For
example,

The convenience of the partition of matrices, say A and B, into blocks is that the result of operations on A
and B can be obtained by carrying out the computation with the blocks, just as if they were the actual
elements of the matrices. This is illustrated below, where the notation A ¼ ½Aij  will be used for a block
matrix A with blocks Aij .
Suppose that A ¼ ½Aij  and B ¼ ½Bij  are block matrices with the same numbers of row and column
blocks, and suppose that corresponding blocks have the same size. Then adding the corresponding blocks
of A and B also adds the corresponding elements of A and B, and multiplying each block of A by a scalar
k multiplies each element of A by k. Thus,

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices

The case of matrix multiplication is less obvious, but still true. That is, suppose that U ¼ ½Uik  and
V ¼ ½Vkj  are block matrices such that the number of columns of each block Uik is equal to the number of
rows of each block Vkj . (Thus, each product Uik Vkj is deﬁned.) Then

(Problem 2.85).

Square Block Matrices
Let M be a block matrix. Then M is called a square block matrix if
(i) M is a square matrix.
(ii) The blocks form a square matrix.
(iii) The diagonal blocks are also square matrices.
The latter two conditions will occur if and only if there are the same number of horizontal and vertical
lines and they are placed symmetrically.

The block matrix A is not a square block matrix, because the second and third diagonal blocks are not
square. On the other hand, the block matrix B is a square block matrix.

Block Diagonal Matrices
Let M ¼ ½Aij  be a square block matrix such that the nondiagonal blocks are all zero matrices; that is,
Aij ¼ 0 when i 6¼ j. Then M is called a block diagonal matrix. We sometimes denote such a block
diagonal matrix by writing
M ¼ diagðA11 ; A22 ; . . . ; Arr Þ

or

M ¼ A11

A22



Arr

The importance of block diagonal matrices is that the algebra of the block matrix is frequently reduced to
the algebra of the individual blocks. Speciﬁcally, suppose f ðxÞ is a polynomial and M is the above block
diagonal matrix. Then f ðMÞ is a block diagonal matrix, and
f ðMÞ ¼ diagð f ðA11 Þ; f ðA22 Þ; . . . ; f ðArr ÞÞ
Also, M is invertible if and only if each Aii is invertible, and, in such a case, M 1 is a block diagonal
matrix, and
1
1
M 1 ¼ diagðA1
11 ; A22 ; . . . ; Arr Þ

Analogously, a square block matrix is called a block upper triangular matrix if the blocks below the
diagonal are zero matrices and a block lower triangular matrix if the blocks above the diagonal are zero
matrices.

(b) B is lower triangular because all blocks above the diagonal are zero blocks.
(c) C is diagonal because the blocks above and below the diagonal are zero blocks.
(d) D is neither upper triangular nor lower triangular. Also, no other partitioning of D will make it into
either a block upper triangular matrix or a block lower triangular matrix.

CHAPTER 2 Algebra of Matrices
(i) The ij-entry of A þ B is aij þ bij ; hence, the ij-entry of ðA þ BÞ þ C is ðaij þ bij Þ þ cij . On the other hand,
the ij-entry of B þ C is bij þ cij ; hence, the ij-entry of A þ ðB þ CÞ is aij þ ðbij þ cij Þ. However, for
scalars in K,
ðaij þ bij Þ þ cij ¼ aij þ ðbij þ cij Þ
Thus, ðA þ BÞ þ C and A þ ðB þ CÞ have identical ij-entries. Therefore, ðA þ BÞ þ C ¼ A þ ðB þ CÞ.
(v)

The ij-entry of A þ B is aij þ bij ; hence, kðaij þ bij Þ is the ij-entry of kðA þ BÞ. On the other hand, the ijentries of kA and kB are kaij and kbij , respectively. Thus, kaij þ kbij is the ij-entry of kA þ kB. However,
for scalars in K,
kðaij þ bij Þ ¼ kaij þ kbij
Thus, kðA þ BÞ and kA þ kB have identical ij-entries. Therefore, kðA þ BÞ ¼ kA þ kB.

(Note that BT ¼ B; such a matrix is said to be symmetric. Note also that the transpose of the row vector C is a

2.13. Prove Theorem 2.3(iv): ðABÞT ¼ BT AT .
Let A ¼ ½aik  and B ¼ ½bkj . Then the ij-entry of AB is
ai1 b1j þ ai2 b2j þ    þ aim bmj
This is the ji-entry (reverse order) of ðABÞT . Now column j of B becomes row j of BT , and row i of A becomes
column i of AT . Thus, the ij-entry of BT AT is
T

½b1j ; b2j ; . . . ; bmj ½ai1 ; ai2 ; . . . ; aim  ¼ b1j ai1 þ b2j ai2 þ    þ bmj aim

(a) The diagonal of A consists of the elements from the upper left corner of A to the lower right corner of A or,
in other words, the elements a11 , a22 , a33 . Thus, the diagonal of A consists of the numbers 1; 5, and 9. The
trace of A is the sum of the diagonal elements. Thus,
trðAÞ ¼ 1  5 þ 9 ¼ 5
(b) The diagonal of B consists of the numbers 2; 7, and 2. Hence,
trðBÞ ¼ 2  7 þ 2 ¼ 3

or

2x  3y ¼ 0

The system reduces to one nondegenerate linear equation in two unknowns, and so has an inﬁnite number
of solutions. To obtain a nonzero solution, let, say, y ¼ 2; then x ¼ 3. Thus, u ¼ ð3; 2ÞT is a desired
nonzero vector.
(b) To ﬁnd the general solution, set y ¼ a, where a is a parameter. Substitute y ¼ a into 2x  3y ¼ 0 to obtain
x ¼ 32 a. Thus, u ¼ ð32 a; aÞT represents all such solutions.

[Note that A is the coefﬁcient matrix for all three systems.]

(a) The product matrix AB is a diagonal matrix obtained by multiplying corresponding diagonal entries; hence,
AB ¼ diagð2ð7Þ; 3ð0Þ; 5ð4ÞÞ ¼ diagð14; 0; 20Þ

Thus, the squares A and B2 are obtained by squaring each diagonal entry; hence,
A2 ¼ diagð22 ; 32 ; 52 Þ ¼ diagð4; 9; 25Þ

B2 ¼ diagð49; 0; 16Þ

and

(b) f ðAÞ is a diagonal matrix obtained by evaluating f ðxÞ at each diagonal entry. We have
f ð2Þ ¼ 4 þ 6  2 ¼ 8;

f ð3Þ ¼ 9 þ 9  2 ¼ 16;

f ð5Þ ¼ 25 þ 15  2 ¼ 38

Thus, f ðAÞ ¼ diagð8; 16; 38Þ.
(c) The inverse of a diagonal matrix is a diagonal matrix obtained by taking the inverse (reciprocal)
of each diagonal entry. Thus, A1 ¼ diagð12 ; 13 ; 15Þ, but B has no inverse because there is a 0 on the
diagonal.

Let AB ¼ ½cij . Then cij ¼ k¼1 aik bkj and cii ¼ k¼1 aik bki . Suppose i > j. Then, for any k, either i > k or

k < i, we have aik ¼ 0; and, for k > i, we have bki ¼ 0. Hence, cii ¼ aii bii , as claimed. [This proves one part of
Theorem 2.5(i); the statements for A þ B and kA are left as exercises.]

(b) By inspection, the diagonal elements are all 0, and the symmetric elements, 4 and 4, 3 and 3, and 5 and

(a) Suppose ðx; yÞ is the second row of A. Because the rows of A form an orthonormal set, we get
x2 þ y2 ¼ 1;
a2 þ b2 ¼ 1;
Similarly, the columns form an orthogonal set, so

ax þ by ¼ 0

b2 þ y2 ¼ 1;
ab þ xy ¼ 0
a2 þ x2 ¼ 1;
2
Therefore, x ¼ 1  a ¼ b , whence x ¼ b:
Case (i): x ¼ b. Then bða þ yÞ ¼ 0, so y ¼ a.
Case (ii): x ¼ b. Then bðy  aÞ ¼ 0, so y ¼ a.

Thus, A is unitary.

2.33. Prove the complex analogue of Theorem 2.6: Let A be a complex matrix. Then the following are
equivalent: (i) A is unitary. (ii) The rows of A form an orthonormal set. (iii) The columns of A
form an orthonormal set.
(The proof is almost identical to the proof on page 37 for the case when A is a 3 3 real matrix.)
First recall that the vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un in Cn form an orthonormal set if they are unit vectors and are
orthogonal to each other, where the dot product in Cn is deﬁned by
ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ  ðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ ¼ a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ    þ an bn
Suppose A is unitary, and R1 ; R2 ; . . . ; Rn are its rows. Then RT1 ; RT2 ; . . . ; RTn are the columns of AH . Let
AAH ¼ ½cij . By matrix multiplication, cij ¼ Ri RTj ¼ Ri  Rj . Because A is unitary, we have AAH ¼ I. Multiplying A by AH and setting each entry cij equal to the corresponding entry in I yields the following n2
equations:
R1  R1 ¼ 1;

R2  R2 ¼ 1;

...;

Rn  Rn ¼ 1;

and

Ri  Rj ¼ 0;

for i 6¼ j

Thus, the rows of A are unit vectors and are orthogonal to each other; hence, they form an orthonormal set of
vectors. The condition AT A ¼ I similarly shows that the columns of A also form an orthonormal set of vectors.
Furthermore, because each step is reversible, the converse is true. This proves the theorem.

Find the size of each block matrix and also the size of each block.
(a) The block matrix has two rows of matrices and three columns of matrices; hence, its size is 2 3. The
block sizes are 2 2, 2 2, and 2 1 for the ﬁrst row; and 1 2, 1 2, and 1 1 for the second row.

Systems of Linear
Equations
3.1

Introduction

Systems of linear equations play an important and motivating role in the subject of linear algebra. In fact,
many problems in linear algebra reduce to ﬁnding the solution of a system of linear equations. Thus, the
techniques introduced in this chapter will be applicable to abstract ideas introduced later. On the other
hand, some of the abstract results will give us new insights into the structure and properties of systems of
linear equations.
All our systems of linear equations involve scalars as both coefﬁcients and constants, and such scalars
may come from any number ﬁeld K. There is almost no loss in generality if the reader assumes that all
our scalars are real numbers—that is, that they come from the real ﬁeld R.

3.2

Basic Deﬁnitions, Solutions

This section gives basic deﬁnitions connected with the solutions of systems of linear equations. The
actual algorithms for ﬁnding such solutions will be treated later.

Linear Equation and Solutions
A linear equation in unknowns x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn is an equation that can be put in the standard form
a1 x1 þ a2 x2 þ    þ an xn ¼ b

ð3:1Þ

where a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an , and b are constants. The constant ak is called the coefﬁcient of xk , and b is called the
constant term of the equation.
A solution of the linear equation (3.1) is a list of values for the unknowns or, equivalently, a vector u in
K n , say
x1 ¼ k1 ;

x2 ¼ k2 ;

...;

xn ¼ kn

or

u ¼ ðk1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn Þ

such that the following statement (obtained by substituting ki for xi in the equation) is true:
a1 k1 þ a2 k2 þ    þ an kn ¼ b
In such a case we say that u satisﬁes the equation.
Remark: Equation (3.1) implicitly assumes there is an ordering of the unknowns. In order to avoid
subscripts, we will usually use x; y for two unknowns; x; y; z for three unknowns; and x; y; z; t for four
unknowns; they will be ordered as shown.

57

58

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

EXAMPLE 3.1 Consider the following linear equation in three unknowns x; y; z:

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 6
We note that x ¼ 5; y ¼ 2; z ¼ 1, or, equivalently, the vector u ¼ ð5; 2; 1Þ is a solution of the equation. That is,

5 þ 2ð2Þ  3ð1Þ ¼ 6

or

5þ43¼6

or 6 ¼ 6

On the other hand, w ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ is not a solution, because on substitution, we do not get a true statement:

1 þ 2ð2Þ  3ð3Þ ¼ 6

or

1þ49¼6

or

4¼6

System of Linear Equations
A system of linear equations is a list of linear equations with the same unknowns. In particular, a system
of m linear equations L1 ; L2 ; . . . ; Lm in n unknowns x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn can be put in the standard form
a11 x1 þ a12 x2 þ    þ a1n xn ¼ b1
a21 x1 þ a22 x2 þ    þ a2n xn ¼ b2

ð3:2Þ

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
am1 x1 þ am2 x2 þ    þ amn xn ¼ bm

where the aij and bi are constants. The number aij is the coefﬁcient of the unknown xj in the equation Li ,
and the number bi is the constant of the equation Li .
The system (3.2) is called an m n (read: m by n) system. It is called a square system if m ¼ n—that
is, if the number m of equations is equal to the number n of unknowns.
The system (3.2) is said to be homogeneous if all the constant terms are zero—that is, if b1 ¼ 0,
b2 ¼ 0; . . . ; bm ¼ 0. Otherwise the system is said to be nonhomogeneous.
A solution (or a particular solution) of the system (3.2) is a list of values for the unknowns or,
equivalently, a vector u in K n , which is a solution of each of the equations in the system. The set of all
solutions of the system is called the solution set or the general solution of the system.
EXAMPLE 3.2 Consider the following system of linear equations:

x1 þ x2 þ 4x3 þ 3x4 ¼ 5
2x1 þ 3x2 þ x3  2x4 ¼ 1
x1 þ 2x2  5x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 3
It is a 3 4 system because it has three equations in four unknowns. Determine whether (a) u ¼ ð8; 6; 1; 1Þ and
(b) v ¼ ð10; 5; 1; 2Þ are solutions of the system.
(a) Substitute the values of u in each equation, obtaining

8 þ 6 þ 4ð1Þ þ 3ð1Þ ¼ 5
2ð8Þ þ 3ð6Þ þ 1  2ð1Þ ¼ 1
8 þ 2ð6Þ  5ð1Þ þ 4ð1Þ ¼ 3

or
or
or

8 þ 6 þ 4 þ 3 ¼ 5
16 þ 18 þ 1  2 ¼ 1
8 þ 12  5 þ 4 ¼ 3

or
or
or

5¼5
1¼1
3¼3

or
or

5¼5
8 ¼ 1

Yes, u is a solution of the system because it is a solution of each equation.
(b) Substitute the values of v into each successive equation, obtaining

10 þ 5 þ 4ð1Þ þ 3ð2Þ ¼ 5
2ð10Þ þ 3ð5Þ þ 1  2ð2Þ ¼ 1

or
or

10 þ 5 þ 4 þ 6 ¼ 5
20 þ 15 þ 1  4 ¼ 1

No, v is not a solution of the system, because it is not a solution of the second equation. (We do not need to
substitute v into the third equation.)

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

59

The system (3.2) of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has one or more solutions, and it is
said to be inconsistent if it has no solution. If the ﬁeld K of scalars is inﬁnite, such as when K is the real
ﬁeld R or the complex ﬁeld C, then we have the following important result.
THEOREM 3.1: Suppose the ﬁeld K is inﬁnite. Then any system l of linear equations has

(i) a unique solution, (ii) no solution, or (iii) an inﬁnite number of solutions.
This situation is pictured in Fig. 3-1. The three cases have a geometrical description when the system
l consists of two equations in two unknowns (Section 3.4).

Figure 3-1

Augmented and Coefﬁcient Matrices of a System
Consider again the general system (3.2) of m equations in n unknowns. Such a system has associated with
it the following two matrices:
2
3
2
3
a11 a12 . . . a1n
a11 a12 . . . a1n b1
6 a21 a22 . . . a2n b2 7
6 a21 a22 . . . a2n 7
7
7
and
A¼6
M ¼6
4::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 5
4 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 5
am1 am2 . . . amn bn
am1 am2 . . . amn
The ﬁrst matrix M is called the augmented matrix of the system, and the second matrix A is called the
coefﬁcient matrix.
The coefﬁcient matrix A is simply the matrix of coefﬁcients, which is the augmented matrix M without
the last column of constants. Some texts write M ¼ ½A; B to emphasize the two parts of M, where B
denotes the column vector of constants. The augmented matrix M and the coefﬁcient matrix A of the
system in Example 3.2 are as follows:
2
3
2
3
1 1
4
3 5
1 1

M ¼ 42 3
1 2 1 5
and
A ¼ 42 3
1 2 5
1 2 5
4 3
1 2 5
4
As expected, A consists of all the columns of M except the last, which is the column of constants.
Clearly, a system of linear equations is completely determined by its augmented matrix M, and vice
versa. Speciﬁcally, each row of M corresponds to an equation of the system, and each column of M
corresponds to the coefﬁcients of an unknown, except for the last column, which corresponds to the
constants of the system.

Degenerate Linear Equations
A linear equation is said to be degenerate if all the coefﬁcients are zero—that is, if it has the form
0x1 þ 0x2 þ    þ 0xn ¼ b

ð3:3Þ

60

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

The solution of such an equation depends only on the value of the constant b. Speciﬁcally,
(i) If b 6¼ 0, then the equation has no solution.
(ii) If b ¼ 0, then every vector u ¼ ðk1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn Þ in K n is a solution.
The following theorem applies.
THEOREM 3.2: Let l be a system of linear equations that contains a degenerate equation L, say with

constant b.
(i)

If b 6¼ 0, then the system l has no solution.

(ii) If b ¼ 0, then L may be deleted from the system without changing the solution
set of the system.
Part (i) comes from the fact that the degenerate equation has no solution, so the system has no solution.
Part (ii) comes from the fact that every element in K n is a solution of the degenerate equation.

Leading Unknown in a Nondegenerate Linear Equation
Now let L be a nondegenerate linear equation. This means one or more of the coefﬁcients of L are not
zero. By the leading unknown of L, we mean the ﬁrst unknown in L with a nonzero coefﬁcient. For
example, x3 and y are the leading unknowns, respectively, in the equations
0x1 þ 0x2 þ 5x3 þ 6x4 þ 0x5 þ 8x6 ¼ 7

and

0x þ 2y  4z ¼ 5

We frequently omit terms with zero coefﬁcients, so the above equations would be written as
5x3 þ 6x4 þ 8x6 ¼ 7

and

2y  4z ¼ 5

In such a case, the leading unknown appears ﬁrst.

3.3

Equivalent Systems, Elementary Operations

Consider the system (3.2) of m linear equations in n unknowns. Let L be the linear equation obtained by
multiplying the m equations by constants c1 ; c2 ; . . . ; cm , respectively, and then adding the resulting
equations. Speciﬁcally, let L be the following linear equation:
ðc1 a11 þ    þ cm am1 Þx1 þ    þ ðc1 a1n þ    þ cm amn Þxn ¼ c1 b1 þ    þ cm bm
Then L is called a linear combination of the equations in the system. One can easily show (Problem 3.43)
that any solution of the system (3.2) is also a solution of the linear combination L.
EXAMPLE 3.3 Let L1 , L2 , L3 denote, respectively, the three equations in Example 3.2. Let L be the

equation obtained by multiplying L1 , L2 , L3 by 3; 2; 4, respectively, and then adding. Namely,
3L1 :
2L2 :
4L1 :

3x1 þ 3x2 þ 12x3 þ 9x4 ¼ 15
4x1  6x2  2x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 2
4x1 þ 8x2  20x3 þ 16x4 ¼ 12

ðSumÞ L:

3x1 þ 5x2  10x3 þ 29x4 ¼ 25

61

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Then L is a linear combination of L1 , L2 , L3 . As expected, the solution u ¼ ð8; 6; 1; 1Þ of the system is also a
solution of L. That is, substituting u in L, we obtain a true statement:

3ð8Þ þ 5ð6Þ  10ð1Þ þ 29ð1Þ ¼ 25

or

24 þ 30  10 þ 29 ¼ 25

or

9¼9

The following theorem holds.
THEOREM 3.3: Two systems of linear equations have the same solutions if and only if each equation in

each system is a linear combination of the equations in the other system.
Two systems of linear equations are said to be equivalent if they have the same solutions. The next
subsection shows one way to obtain equivalent systems of linear equations.

Elementary Operations
The following operations on a system of linear equations L1 ; L2 ; . . . ; Lm are called elementary operations.
½E1  Interchange two of the equations. We indicate that the equations Li and Lj are interchanged by
writing:
‘‘Interchange Li and Lj ’’
or
‘‘Li ! Lj ’’
½E2  Replace an equation by a nonzero multiple of itself. We indicate that equation Li is replaced by kLi
(where k 6¼ 0) by writing
or
‘‘kLi ! Li ’’
‘‘Replace Li by kLi ’’
½E3  Replace an equation by the sum of a multiple of another equation and itself. We indicate that
equation Lj is replaced by the sum of kLi and Lj by writing
‘‘Replace Lj by kLi þ Lj ’’
or
‘‘kLi þ Lj ! Lj ’’
The arrow ! in ½E2  and ½E3  may be read as ‘‘replaces.’’
The main property of the above elementary operations is contained in the following theorem (proved
in Problem 3.45).
THEOREM 3.4: Suppose a system of m of linear equations is obtained from a system l of linear

equations by a ﬁnite sequence of elementary operations. Then m and l have the same
solutions.

Remark: Sometimes (say to avoid fractions when all the given scalars are integers) we may apply
½E2  and ½E3  in one step; that is, we may apply the following operation:
Replace equation Lj by the sum of kLi and k 0 Lj (where k 0 6¼ 0), written
or
‘‘kLi þ k 0 Lj ! Lj ’’
‘‘Replace Lj by kLi þ k 0 Lj ’’

½E

We emphasize that in operations ½E3  and [E], only equation Lj is changed.
Gaussian elimination, our main method for ﬁnding the solution of a given system of linear
equations, consists of using the above operations to transform a given system into an equivalent
system whose solution can be easily obtained.
The details of Gaussian elimination are discussed in subsequent sections.

3.4

Small Square Systems of Linear Equations

This section considers the special case of one equation in one unknown, and two equations in two
unknowns. These simple systems are treated separately because their solution sets can be described
geometrically, and their properties motivate the general case.

62

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Linear Equation in One Unknown
The following simple basic result is proved in Problem 3.5.
THEOREM 3.5: Consider the linear equation ax ¼ b.

(i) If a 6¼ 0, then x ¼ b=a is a unique solution of ax ¼ b.
(ii) If a ¼ 0, but b 6¼ 0, then ax ¼ b has no solution.
(iii) If a ¼ 0 and b ¼ 0, then every scalar k is a solution of ax ¼ b.
EXAMPLE 3.4 Solve (a)

4x  1 ¼ x þ 6, (b)

2x  5  x ¼ x þ 3, (c)

4 þ x  3 ¼ 2x þ 1  x.

(a) Rewrite the equation in standard form obtaining 3x ¼ 7. Then x ¼ 73 is the unique solution [Theorem 3.5(i)].
(b) Rewrite the equation in standard form, obtaining 0x ¼ 8. The equation has no solution [Theorem 3.5(ii)].
(c) Rewrite the equation in standard form, obtaining 0x ¼ 0. Then every scalar k is a solution [Theorem 3.5(iii)].

System of Two Linear Equations in Two Unknowns (2 2 System)
Consider a system of two nondegenerate linear equations in two unknowns x and y, which can be put in
the standard form
A1 x þ B1 y ¼ C1

ð3:4Þ

A2 x þ B2 y ¼ C2

Because the equations are nondegenerate, A1 and B1 are not both zero, and A2 and B2 are not both zero.
The general solution of the system (3.4) belongs to one of three types as indicated in Fig. 3-1. If R is
the ﬁeld of scalars, then the graph of each equation is a line in the plane R2 and the three types may be
described geometrically as pictured in Fig. 3-2. Speciﬁcally,
(1)

The system has exactly one solution.
Here the two lines intersect in one point [Fig. 3-2(a)]. This occurs when the lines have distinct
slopes or, equivalently, when the coefﬁcients of x and y are not proportional:
A1 B1
6¼
A2 B2

A1 B2  A2 B1 6¼ 0

or; equivalently;

For example, in Fig. 3-2(a), 1=3 6¼ 1=2.

Here the two lines are parallel [Fig. 3-2(b)]. This occurs when the lines have the same slopes but
different y intercepts, or when

For example, in Fig. 3-2(b), 1=2 ¼ 3=6 6¼ 3=8.
The system has an inﬁnite number of solutions.
Here the two lines coincide [Fig. 3-2(c)]. This occurs when the lines have the same slopes and same
y intercepts, or when the coefﬁcients and constants are proportional,
A1 B1 C1

A2 B2 C2
For example, in Fig. 3-2(c), 1=2 ¼ 2=4 ¼ 4=8.
Remark: The following expression and its value is called a determinant of order two:


 A1 B1 


 A2 B2  ¼ A1 B2  A2 B1

Determinants will be studied in Chapter 8. Thus, the system (3.4) has a unique solution if and only if the
determinant of its coefﬁcients is not zero. (We show later that this statement is true for any square system
of linear equations.)

Elimination Algorithm
The solution to system (3.4) can be obtained by the process of elimination, whereby we reduce the system
to a single equation in only one unknown. Assuming the system has a unique solution, this elimination
algorithm has two parts.
ALGORITHM 3.1: The input consists of two nondegenerate linear equations L1 and L2 in two

unknowns with a unique solution.
Part A. (Forward Elimination) Multiply each equation by a constant so that the resulting coefﬁcients of
one unknown are negatives of each other, and then add the two equations to obtain a new
equation L that has only one unknown.
Part B. (Back-Substitution) Solve for the unknown in the new equation L (which contains only one
unknown), substitute this value of the unknown into one of the original equations, and then
solve to obtain the value of the other unknown.
Part A of Algorithm 3.1 can be applied to any system even if the system does not have a unique
solution. In such a case, the new equation L will be degenerate and Part B will not apply.
EXAMPLE 3.5 (Unique Case). Solve the system

L1 : 2x  3y ¼ 8
L2 : 3x þ 4y ¼

5

The unknown x is eliminated from the equations by forming the new equation L ¼ 3L1 þ 2L2 . That is, we
multiply L1 by 3 and L2 by 2 and add the resulting equations as follows:

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

We now solve the new equation for y, obtaining y ¼ 2. We substitute y ¼ 2 into one of the original equations, say
L1 , and solve for the other unknown x, obtaining

2x  3ð2Þ ¼ 8

2x  6 ¼ 8

or

or

2x ¼ 2

or

x ¼ 1

Thus, x ¼ 1, y ¼ 2, or the pair u ¼ ð1; 2Þ is the unique solution of the system. The unique solution is expected,
because 2=3 6¼ 3=4. [Geometrically, the lines corresponding to the equations intersect at the point ð1; 2Þ.]
EXAMPLE 3.6 (Nonunique Cases)
(a) Solve the system

L1 :

x  3y ¼ 4

L2 : 2x þ 6y ¼ 5
We eliminated x from the equations by multiplying L1 by 2 and adding it to L2 —that is, by forming the new
equation L ¼ 2L1 þ L2 . This yields the degenerate equation

0x þ 0y ¼ 13
which has a nonzero constant b ¼ 13. Thus, this equation and the system have no solution. This is expected,
because 1=ð2Þ ¼ 3=6 6¼ 4=5. (Geometrically, the lines corresponding to the equations are parallel.)
(b) Solve the system

L1 :

x  3y ¼ 4

L2 :

2x þ 6y ¼ 8

We eliminated x from the equations by multiplying L1 by 2 and adding it to L2 —that is, by forming the new
equation L ¼ 2L1 þ L2 . This yields the degenerate equation

0x þ 0y ¼ 0
where the constant term is also zero. Thus, the system has an inﬁnite number of solutions, which correspond to
the solutions of either equation. This is expected, because 1=ð2Þ ¼ 3=6 ¼ 4=ð8Þ. (Geometrically, the lines
corresponding to the equations coincide.)
To ﬁnd the general solution, let y ¼ a, and substitute into L1 to obtain

x  3a ¼ 4

or

x ¼ 3a þ 4

Thus, the general solution of the system is

x ¼ 3a þ 4; y ¼ a

or

u ¼ ð3a þ 4; aÞ

where a (called a parameter) is any scalar.

Systems in Triangular and Echelon Forms

The main method for solving systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination, is treated in Section 3.6.
Here we consider two simple types of systems of linear equations: systems in triangular form and the
more general systems in echelon form.

Triangular Form
Consider the following system of linear equations, which is in triangular form:
2x1  3x2 þ 5x3  2x4 ¼ 9
5x2  x3 þ 3x4 ¼ 1
7x3  x4 ¼ 3
2x4 ¼ 8

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

65

That is, the ﬁrst unknown x1 is the leading unknown in the ﬁrst equation, the second unknown x2 is the
leading unknown in the second equation, and so on. Thus, in particular, the system is square and each
leading unknown is directly to the right of the leading unknown in the preceding equation.
Such a triangular system always has a unique solution, which may be obtained by back-substitution.
That is,
(1) First solve the last equation for the last unknown to get x4 ¼ 4.
(2) Then substitute this value x4 ¼ 4 in the next-to-last equation, and solve for the next-to-last unknown
x3 as follows:
7x3  4 ¼ 3

or

7x3 ¼ 7

or

x3 ¼ 1

(3) Now substitute x3 ¼ 1 and x4 ¼ 4 in the second equation, and solve for the second unknown x2 as
follows:
5x2  1 þ 12 ¼ 1
or
5x2 þ 11 ¼ 1
or
5x2 ¼ 10
or
x2 ¼ 2
(4) Finally, substitute x2 ¼ 2, x3 ¼ 1, x4 ¼ 4 in the ﬁrst equation, and solve for the ﬁrst unknown x1 as
follows:
2x1 þ 6 þ 5  8 ¼ 9
or
2x1 þ 3 ¼ 9
or
2x1 ¼ 6
or
x1 ¼ 3
Thus, x1 ¼ 3 , x2 ¼ 2, x3 ¼ 1, x4 ¼ 4, or, equivalently, the vector u ¼ ð3; 2; 1; 4Þ is the unique
solution of the system.
Remark: There is an alternative form for back-substitution (which will be used when solving a
system using the matrix format). Namely, after ﬁrst ﬁnding the value of the last unknown, we substitute
this value for the last unknown in all the preceding equations before solving for the next-to-last
unknown. This yields a triangular system with one less equation and one less unknown. For example, in
the above triangular system, we substitute x4 ¼ 4 in all the preceding equations to obtain the triangular
system
2x1  3x2 þ 5x3 ¼ 17
5x2  x3 ¼ 1
7x3 ¼ 7
We then repeat the process using the new last equation. And so on.

Echelon Form, Pivot and Free Variables
The following system of linear equations is said to be in echelon form:
2x1 þ 6x2  x3 þ 4x4  2x5 ¼ 15
x3 þ 2x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 5
3x4  9x5 ¼ 6
That is, no equation is degenerate and the leading unknown in each equation other than the ﬁrst is to the
right of the leading unknown in the preceding equation. The leading unknowns in the system, x1 , x3 , x4 ,
are called pivot variables, and the other unknowns, x2 and x5 , are called free variables.
Generally speaking, an echelon system or a system in echelon form has the following form:
a11 x1 þ a12 x2 þ a13 x3 þ a14 x4 þ    þ a1n xn ¼ b1
a2j2 xj2 þ a2;j2 þ1 xj2 þ1 þ    þ a2n xn ¼ b2
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
arjr xjr þ    þ arn xn ¼ br

ð3:5Þ

where 1 < j2 <    < jr and a11 , a2j2 ; . . . ; arjr are not zero. The pivot variables are x1 , xj2 ; . . . ; xjr . Note
that r  n.
The solution set of any echelon system is described in the following theorem (proved in Problem 3.10).

66

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

THEOREM 3.6: Consider a system of linear equations in echelon form, say with r equations in n

unknowns. There are two cases:
(i) r ¼ n. That is, there are as many equations as unknowns (triangular form). Then
the system has a unique solution.
(ii) r < n. That is, there are more unknowns than equations. Then we can arbitrarily
assign values to the n  r free variables and solve uniquely for the r pivot
variables, obtaining a solution of the system.
Suppose an echelon system contains more unknowns than equations. Assuming the ﬁeld K is inﬁnite,
the system has an inﬁnite number of solutions, because each of the n  r free variables may be assigned
any scalar.
The general solution of a system with free variables may be described in either of two equivalent ways,
which we illustrate using the above echelon system where there are r ¼ 3 equations and n ¼ 5 unknowns.
One description is called the ‘‘Parametric Form’’ of the solution, and the other description is called the
‘‘Free-Variable Form.’’

Parametric Form
Assign arbitrary values, called parameters, to the free variables x2 and x5 , say x2 ¼ a and x5 ¼ b, and
then use back-substitution to obtain values for the pivot variables x1 , x3 , x5 in terms of the parameters a
and b. Speciﬁcally,
(1) Substitute x5 ¼ b in the last equation, and solve for x4 :
3x4  9b ¼ 6

or

3x4 ¼ 6 þ 9b

x4 ¼ 2 þ 3b

or

(2) Substitute x4 ¼ 2 þ 3b and x5 ¼ b into the second equation, and solve for x3 :
x3 þ 2ð2 þ 3bÞ þ 2b ¼ 5

or

x3 þ 4 þ 8b ¼ 5

x3 ¼ 1  8b

or

(3) Substitute x2 ¼ a, x3 ¼ 1  8b, x4 ¼ 2 þ 3b, x5 ¼ b into the ﬁrst equation, and solve for x1 :
2x1 þ 6a  ð1  8bÞ þ 4ð2 þ 3bÞ  2b ¼ 15

or

x1 ¼ 4  3a  9b

Accordingly, the general solution in parametric form is
x1 ¼ 4  3a  9b;

x2 ¼ a;

x3 ¼ 1  8b;

x4 ¼ 2 þ 3b;

x5 ¼ b

or, equivalently, v ¼ ð4  3a  9b; a; 1  8b; 2 þ 3b; bÞ where a and b are arbitrary numbers.

Free-Variable Form
Use back-substitution to solve for the pivot variables x1 , x3 , x4 directly in terms of the free variables x2
and x5 . That is, the last equation gives x4 ¼ 2 þ 3x5 . Substitution in the second equation yields
x3 ¼ 1  8x5 , and then substitution in the ﬁrst equation yields x1 ¼ 4  3x2  9x5 . Accordingly,
x1 ¼ 4  3x2  9x5 ;

x2 ¼ free variable;

x3 ¼ 1  8x5 ;

x4 ¼ 2 þ 3x5 ;

x5 ¼ free variable

or, equivalently,
v ¼ ð4  3x2  9x5 ; x2 ; 1  8x5 ; 2 þ 3x5 ; x5 Þ
is the free-variable form for the general solution of the system.
We emphasize that there is no difference between the above two forms of the general solution, and the
use of one or the other to represent the general solution is simply a matter of taste.
Remark: A particular solution of the above system can be found by assigning any values to the free
variables and then solving for the pivot variables by back-substitution. For example, setting x2 ¼ 1 and
x5 ¼ 1, we obtain
x4 ¼ 2 þ 3 ¼ 5;

x3 ¼ 1  8 ¼ 7;

x1 ¼ 4  3  9 ¼ 8

Thus, u ¼ ð8; 1; 7; 5; 1Þ is the particular solution corresponding to x2 ¼ 1 and x5 ¼ 1.

Gaussian Elimination

The main method for solving the general system (3.2) of linear equations is called Gaussian elimination.
It essentially consists of two parts:
Part A. (Forward Elimination) Step-by-step reduction of the system yielding either a degenerate
equation with no solution (which indicates the system has no solution) or an equivalent simpler
system in triangular or echelon form.
Part B. (Backward Elimination) Step-by-step back-substitution to ﬁnd the solution of the simpler
system.
Part B has already been investigated in Section 3.4. Accordingly, we need only give the algorithm for
Part A, which is as follows.
ALGORITHM 3.2 for (Part A): Input: The m
ELIMINATION STEP:

n system (3.2) of linear equations.

Find the ﬁrst unknown in the system with a nonzero coefﬁcient (which now
must be x1 ).

(a) Arrange so that a11 6¼ 0. That is, if necessary, interchange equations so that the ﬁrst unknown x1
appears with a nonzero coefﬁcient in the ﬁrst equation.
(b) Use a11 as a pivot to eliminate x1 from all equations except the ﬁrst equation. That is, for i > 1:
(1) Set m ¼ ai1 =a11 ;

(2) Replace Li by mL1 þ Li

The system now has the following form:
a11 x1 þ a12 x2 þ a13 x3 þ    þ a1n xn ¼ b1
a2j2 xj2 þ    þ a2n xn ¼ b2
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
amj2 xj2 þ    þ amn xn ¼ bn
where x1 does not appear in any equation except the ﬁrst, a11 6¼ 0, and xj2 denotes the ﬁrst
unknown with a nonzero coefﬁcient in any equation other than the ﬁrst.
(c) Examine each new equation L.
(1) If L has the form 0x1 þ 0x2 þ    þ 0xn ¼ b with b 6¼ 0, then
STOP
The system is inconsistent and has no solution.
(2) If L has the form 0x1 þ 0x2 þ    þ 0xn ¼ 0 or if L is a multiple of another equation, then delete
L from the system.
RECURSION STEP:
OUTPUT:

Repeat the Elimination Step with each new ‘‘smaller’’ subsystem formed by all
the equations excluding the ﬁrst equation.

Finally, the system is reduced to triangular or echelon form, or a degenerate equation with
no solution is obtained indicating an inconsistent system.

The next remarks refer to the Elimination Step in Algorithm 3.2.
(1) The following number m in (b) is called the multiplier:
m¼

ai1
coefficient to be deleted
¼
pivot
a11

(2) One could alternatively apply the following operation in (b):
Replace Li by  ai1 L1 þ a11 Li
This would avoid fractions if all the scalars were originally integers.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Gaussian Elimination Example
Here we illustrate in detail Gaussian elimination using the following system of linear equations:
L1 :
L2 :
L3 :

x  3y  2z ¼ 6
2x  4y  3z ¼ 8
3x þ 6y þ 8z ¼ 5

Part A. We use the coefﬁcient 1 of x in the ﬁrst equation L1 as the pivot in order to eliminate x from
the second equation L2 and from the third equation L3 . This is accomplished as follows:
(1) Multiply L1 by the multiplier m ¼ 2 and add it to L2 ; that is, ‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 .’’
(2) Multiply L1 by the multiplier m ¼ 3 and add it to L3 ; that is, ‘‘Replace L3 by 3L1 þ L3 .’’
These steps yield
ð2ÞL1 :
L2 :

2x þ 6y þ 4z ¼ 12
2x  4y  3z ¼
8

3L1 :
L3 :

3x  9y  6z ¼ 18
3x þ 6y þ 8z ¼ 5

New L2 :

2y þ z ¼ 4

New L3 :

3y þ 2z ¼ 13

Thus, the original system is replaced by the following system:
L1 :
L2 :
L3 :

x  3y  2z ¼ 6
2y þ z ¼ 4
3y þ 2z ¼ 13

(Note that the equations L2 and L3 form a subsystem with one less equation and one less unknown than
the original system.)
Next we use the coefﬁcient 2 of y in the (new) second equation L2 as the pivot in order to eliminate y
from the (new) third equation L3 . This is accomplished as follows:
(3) Multiply L2 by the multiplier m ¼ 32 and add it to L3 ; that is, ‘‘Replace L3 by 32 L2 þ L3 :’’
(Alternately, ‘‘Replace L3 by 3L2 þ 2L3 ,’’ which will avoid fractions.)
This step yields
3
2 L2 :

L3 :

3y þ 32 z ¼ 6
3y þ 2z ¼ 13

New L3 :

7
2z ¼

or

3L2 :
2L3 :

6y þ 3z ¼ 12
6y þ 4z ¼ 26

New L3 :

7

7z ¼

14

Thus, our system is replaced by the following system:
L1 :
L2 :
L3 :

x  3y  2z ¼ 6
2y þ z ¼ 4
7z ¼ 14 ðor 72 z ¼ 7Þ

The system is now in triangular form, so Part A is completed.
Part B. The values for the unknowns are obtained in reverse order, z; y; x, by back-substitution.
Speciﬁcally,
(1) Solve for z in L3 to get z ¼ 2.
(2) Substitute z ¼ 2 in L2 , and solve for y to get y ¼ 3.
(3) Substitute y ¼ 3 and z ¼ 2 in L1 , and solve for x to get x ¼ 1.
Thus, the solution of the triangular system and hence the original system is as follows:
x ¼ 1;

y ¼ 3;

z¼2

or; equivalently;

u ¼ ð1; 3; 2Þ:

69

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Condensed Format
The Gaussian elimination algorithm involves rewriting systems of linear equations. Sometimes we can
avoid excessive recopying of some of the equations by adopting a ‘‘condensed format.’’ This format for
the solution of the above system follows:
Number
ð1Þ
ð2Þ
ð3Þ
ð20 Þ
ð30 Þ
ð300 Þ

Equation
x  3y  2z ¼ 6
2x  4y  3z ¼ 8
3x þ 6y þ 8z ¼ 5
2y þ z ¼ 4
 3y þ 2z ¼ 13
7z ¼ 14

Operation

Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2
Replace L3 by 3L1 þ L3
Replace L3 by 3L2 þ 2L3

That is, ﬁrst we write down the number of each of the original equations. As we apply the Gaussian
elimination algorithm to the system, we only write down the new equations, and we label each new equation
using the same number as the original corresponding equation, but with an added prime. (After each new
equation, we will indicate, for instructional purposes, the elementary operation that yielded the new equation.)
The system in triangular form consists of equations (1), ð20 Þ, and ð300 Þ, the numbers with the largest
number of primes. Applying back-substitution to these equations again yields x ¼ 1, y ¼ 3, z ¼ 2.
Remark: If two equations need to be interchanged, say to obtain a nonzero coefﬁcient as a pivot,
then this is easily accomplished in the format by simply renumbering the two equations rather than
changing their positions.
x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1

EXAMPLE 3.7 Solve the following system:

2x þ 5y  8z ¼ 4
3x þ 8y  13z ¼ 7
We solve the system by Gaussian elimination.
Part A. (Forward Elimination) We use the coefﬁcient 1 of x in the ﬁrst equation L1 as the pivot in order to
eliminate x from the second equation L2 and from the third equation L3 . This is accomplished as follows:
(1) Multiply L1 by the multiplier m ¼ 2 and add it to L2 ; that is, ‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 .’’
(2) Multiply L1 by the multiplier m ¼ 3 and add it to L3 ; that is, ‘‘Replace L3 by 3L1 þ L3 .’’
The two steps yield

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
y  2z ¼ 2
2y  4z ¼ 4

or

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
y  2z ¼ 2

(The third equation is deleted, because it is a multiple of the second equation.) The system is now in echelon form
with free variable z.
Part B. (Backward Elimination) To obtain the general solution, let the free variable z ¼ a, and solve for x and y
by back-substitution. Substitute z ¼ a in the second equation to obtain y ¼ 2 þ 2a. Then substitute z ¼ a and
y ¼ 2 þ 2a into the ﬁrst equation to obtain

x þ 2ð2 þ 2aÞ  3a ¼ 1

or

x þ 4 þ 4a  3a ¼ 1

or

x ¼ 3  a

Thus, the following is the general solution where a is a parameter:

x ¼ 3  a;

y ¼ 2 þ 2a;

z¼a

or

u ¼ ð3  a; 2 þ 2a; aÞ

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

EXAMPLE 3.8 Solve the following system:

x1 þ 3x2  2x3 þ 5x4 ¼ 4
2x1 þ 8x2 

x3 þ 9x4 ¼ 9

3x1 þ 5x2  12x3 þ 17x4 ¼ 7
We use Gaussian elimination.
Part A. (Forward Elimination) We use the coefﬁcient 1 of x1 in the ﬁrst equation L1 as the pivot in order to
eliminate x1 from the second equation L2 and from the third equation L3 . This is accomplished by the following
operations:
(1) ‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 ’’ and (2) ‘‘Replace L3 by 3L1 þ L3 ’’
These yield:

x1 þ 3x2  2x3 þ 5x4 ¼
2x2 þ 3x3  x4 ¼

4
1

 4x2  6x3 þ 2x4 ¼ 5
We now use the coefﬁcient 2 of x2 in the second equation L2 as the pivot and the multiplier m ¼ 2 in order to
eliminate x2 from the third equation L3 . This is accomplished by the operation ‘‘Replace L3 by 2L2 þ L3 ,’’ which
then yields the degenerate equation

0x1 þ 0x2 þ 0x3 þ 0x4 ¼ 3
This equation and, hence, the original system have no solution:

DO NOT CONTINUE
Remark 1: As in the above examples, Part A of Gaussian elimination tells us whether or not the
system has a solution—that is, whether or not the system is consistent. Accordingly, Part B need never be
applied when a system has no solution.
Remark 2: If a system of linear equations has more than four unknowns and four equations, then it
may be more convenient to use the matrix format for solving the system. This matrix format is discussed
later.

3.7

Echelon Matrices, Row Canonical Form, Row Equivalence

One way to solve a system of linear equations is by working with its augmented matrix M rather than the
system itself. This section introduces the necessary matrix concepts for such a discussion. These
concepts, such as echelon matrices and elementary row operations, are also of independent interest.

Echelon Matrices
A matrix A is called an echelon matrix, or is said to be in echelon form, if the following two conditions
hold (where a leading nonzero element of a row of A is the ﬁrst nonzero element in the row):
(1) All zero rows, if any, are at the bottom of the matrix.
(2) Each leading nonzero entry in a row is to the right of the leading nonzero entry in the preceding row.
That is, A ¼ ½aij  is an echelon matrix if there exist nonzero entries
a1j1 ; a2j2 ; . . . ; arjr ;

where

j1 < j2 <    < jr

71

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
with the property that
aij ¼ 0

ðiÞ i  r;
ðiiÞ i > r

for

j < ji

The entries a1j1 , a2j2 ; . . . ; arjr , which are the leading nonzero elements in their respective rows, are called
the pivots of the echelon matrix.
EXAMPLE 3.9 The following is an echelon matrix whose pivots have been circled:

Observe that the pivots are in columns C2 ; C4 ; C6 ; C7 , and each is to the right of the one above. Using the above
notation, the pivots are

a1j1 ¼ 2;

a2j2 ¼ 3;

a3j3 ¼ 5;

a4j4 ¼ 8

j1 ¼ 2, j2 ¼ 4, j3 ¼ 6, j4 ¼ 7. Here r ¼ 4.

where

Row Canonical Form
A matrix A is said to be in row canonical form (or row-reduced echelon form) if it is an echelon matrix—
that is, if it satisﬁes the above properties (1) and (2), and if it satisﬁes the following additional two
properties:
(3) Each pivot (leading nonzero entry) is equal to 1.
(4) Each pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column.
The major difference between an echelon matrix and a matrix in row canonical form is that in an
echelon matrix there must be zeros below the pivots [Properties (1) and (2)], but in a matrix in row
canonical form, each pivot must also equal 1 [Property (3)] and there must also be zeros above the pivots
[Property (4)].
The zero matrix 0 of any size and the identity matrix I of any size are important special examples of
matrices in row canonical form.

The following are echelon matrices whose pivots have been circled:

The third matrix is also an example of a matrix in row canonical form. The second matrix is not in row canonical
form, because it does not satisfy property (4); that is, there is a nonzero entry above the second pivot in the third
column. The ﬁrst matrix is not in row canonical form, because it satisﬁes neither property (3) nor property (4); that
is, some pivots are not equal to 1 and there are nonzero entries above the pivots.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Elementary Row Operations
Suppose A is a matrix with rows R1 ; R2 ; . . . ; Rm . The following operations on A are called elementary row
operations.
½E1  (Row Interchange): Interchange rows Ri and Rj . This may be written as
‘‘Interchange Ri and Rj ’’

or

‘‘Ri

! Rj ’’

½E2  (Row Scaling): Replace row Ri by a nonzero multiple kRi of itself. This may be written as
‘‘Replace Ri by kRi ðk 6¼ 0Þ’’

or

‘‘kRi ! Ri ’’

½E3  (Row Addition): Replace row Rj by the sum of a multiple kRi of a row Ri and itself. This may be
written as
‘‘Replace Rj by kRi þ Rj ’’
or
‘‘kRi þ Rj ! Rj ’’
The arrow ! in E2 and E3 may be read as ‘‘replaces.’’
Sometimes (say to avoid fractions when all the given scalars are integers) we may apply ½E2  and ½E3 
in one step; that is, we may apply the following operation:
½E

Replace Rj by the sum of a multiple kRi of a row Ri and a nonzero multiple k 0 Rj of itself. This may
be written as
‘‘Replace Rj by kRi þ k 0 Rj ðk 0 6¼ 0Þ’’

or

‘‘kRi þ k 0 Rj ! Rj ’’

We emphasize that in operations ½E3  and ½E  only row Rj is changed.

Row Equivalence, Rank of a Matrix
A matrix A is said to be row equivalent to a matrix B, written
A B
if B can be obtained from A by a sequence of elementary row operations. In the case that B is also an
echelon matrix, B is called an echelon form of A.
The following are two basic results on row equivalence.
THEOREM 3.7: Suppose A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  are row equivalent echelon matrices with respective

pivot entries
a1j1 ; a2j2 ; . . . arjr

and

b1k1 ; b2k2 ; . . . bsks

Then A and B have the same number of nonzero rows—that is, r ¼ s—and the pivot
entries are in the same positions—that is, j1 ¼ k1 , j2 ¼ k2 ; . . . ; jr ¼ kr .
THEOREM 3.8: Every matrix A is row equivalent to a unique matrix in row canonical form.

The proofs of the above theorems will be postponed to Chapter 4. The unique matrix in Theorem 3.8
is called the row canonical form of A.
Using the above theorems, we can now give our ﬁrst deﬁnition of the rank of a matrix.
DEFINITION:

The rank of a matrix A, written rankðAÞ, is equal to the number of pivots in an echelon
form of A.

The rank is a very important property of a matrix and, depending on the context in which the
matrix is used, it will be deﬁned in many different ways. Of course, all the deﬁnitions lead to the
same number.
The next section gives the matrix format of Gaussian elimination, which ﬁnds an echelon form of any
matrix A (and hence the rank of A), and also ﬁnds the row canonical form of A.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
One can show that row equivalence is an equivalence relation. That is,
(1) A A for any matrix A.
(2) If A B, then B A.
(3) If A B and B C, then A

C.

Property (2) comes from the fact that each elementary row operation has an inverse operation of the same
type. Namely,
(i) ‘‘Interchange Ri and Rj ’’ is its own inverse.
(ii) ‘‘Replace Ri by kRi ’’ and ‘‘Replace Ri by ð1=kÞRi ’’ are inverses.
(iii) ‘‘Replace Rj by kRi þ Rj ’’ and ‘‘Replace Rj by kRi þ Rj ’’ are inverses.
There is a similar result for operation [E] (Problem 3.73).

3.8

Gaussian Elimination, Matrix Formulation

This section gives two matrix algorithms that accomplish the following:
(1) Algorithm 3.3 transforms any matrix A into an echelon form.
(2) Algorithm 3.4 transforms the echelon matrix into its row canonical form.
These algorithms, which use the elementary row operations, are simply restatements of Gaussian
elimination as applied to matrices rather than to linear equations. (The term ‘‘row reduce’’ or simply
‘‘reduce’’ will mean to transform a matrix by the elementary row operations.)
ALGORITHM 3.3 (Forward Elimination): The input is any matrix A. (The algorithm puts 0’s below

each pivot, working from the ‘‘top-down.’’) The output is
an echelon form of A.
Step 1. Find the ﬁrst column with a nonzero entry. Let j1 denote this column.
Arrange so that a1j1 6¼ 0. That is, if necessary, interchange rows so that a nonzero entry
appears in the ﬁrst row in column j1 .
(b) Use a1j1 as a pivot to obtain 0’s below a1j1 .

(a)

Speciﬁcally, for i > 1:
ð1Þ Set m ¼ aij1 =a1j1 ;

ð2Þ Replace Ri by mR1 þ Ri

[That is, apply the operation ðaij1 =a1j1 ÞR1 þ Ri ! Ri :]
Step 2.

Repeat Step 1 with the submatrix formed by all the rows excluding the ﬁrst row. Here we let j2
denote the ﬁrst column in the subsystem with a nonzero entry. Hence, at the end of Step 2, we
have a2j2 6¼ 0.

Steps 3 to r.

Continue the above process until a submatrix has only zero rows.

We emphasize that at the end of the algorithm, the pivots will be
a1j1 ; a2j2 ; . . . ; arjr
where r denotes the number of nonzero rows in the ﬁnal echelon matrix.
Remark 1:
m¼

The following number m in Step 1(b) is called the multiplier:

aij1
entry to be deleted
¼
a1j1
pivot

74

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Remark 2: One could replace the operation in Step 1(b) by the following which would avoid
fractions if all the scalars were originally integers.
Replace Ri by aij1 R1 þ a1j1 Ri :
ALGORITHM 3.4 (Backward Elimination): The input is a matrix A ¼ ½aij  in echelon form with pivot

entries
a1j1 ;

a2j2 ;

...;

arjr

The output is the row canonical form of A.
Step 1. (a)

(Use row scaling so the last pivot equals 1.) Multiply the last nonzero row Rr by 1=arjr .

(b) (Use arjr ¼ 1 to obtain 0’s above the pivot.) For i ¼ r  1;
ð1Þ Set m ¼ aijr ;

r  2;

...;

2;

1:

ð2Þ Replace Ri by mRr þ Ri

(That is, apply the operations aijr Rr þ Ri ! Ri .)
Steps 2 to r1.

Repeat Step 1 for rows Rr1 , Rr2 ; . . . ; R2 .

Step r. (Use row scaling so the ﬁrst pivot equals 1.) Multiply R1 by 1=a1j1 .
There is an alternative form of Algorithm 3.4, which we describe here in words. The formal
description of this algorithm is left to the reader as a supplementary problem.
ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM 3.4 Puts 0’s above the pivots row by row from the bottom up (rather

than column by column from right to left).
The alternative algorithm, when applied to an augmented matrix M of a system of linear equations, is
essentially the same as solving for the pivot unknowns one after the other from the bottom up.
Remark: We emphasize that Gaussian elimination is a two-stage process. Speciﬁcally,
Stage A (Algorithm 3.3). Puts 0’s below each pivot, working from the top row R1 down.
Stage B (Algorithm 3.4). Puts 0’s above each pivot, working from the bottom row Rr up.
There is another algorithm, called Gauss–Jordan, that also row reduces a matrix to its row canonical
form. The difference is that Gauss–Jordan puts 0’s both below and above each pivot as it works its way
from the top row R1 down. Although Gauss–Jordan may be easier to state and understand, it is much less
efﬁcient than the two-stage Gaussian elimination algorithm.

Application to Systems of Linear Equations
One way to solve a system of linear equations is by working with its augmented matrix M rather than the
equations themselves. Speciﬁcally, we reduce M to echelon form (which tells us whether the system has a
solution), and then further reduce M to its row canonical form (which essentially gives the solution of the
original system of linear equations). The justiﬁcation for this process comes from the following facts:
(1) Any elementary row operation on the augmented matrix M of the system is equivalent to applying
the corresponding operation on the system itself.
(2) The system has a solution if and only if the echelon form of the augmented matrix M does not have a
row of the form ð0; 0; . . . ; 0; bÞ with b 6¼ 0.
(3) In the row canonical form of the augmented matrix M (excluding zero rows), the coefﬁcient of each
basic variable is a pivot entry equal to 1, and it is the only nonzero entry in its respective column;
hence, the free-variable form of the solution of the system of linear equations is obtained by simply
transferring the free variables to the other side.
This process is illustrated below.
EXAMPLE 3.12

Solve each of the following systems:

x1 þ x2  2x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 5
2x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ x4 ¼ 3
3x1 þ 3x2  4x3  2x4 ¼ 1

2x1 þ 3x2 þ 3x3  x4 ¼ 3
5x1 þ 7x2 þ 4x3 þ x4 ¼ 5

Rewrite the row canonical form in terms of a system of linear equations to obtain the free variable form of the

x3  7x4 ¼ 7

or

x1 ¼ 9  x2 þ 10x4
x3 ¼ 7 þ 7x4

(The zero row is omitted in the solution.) Observe that x1 and x3 are the pivot variables, and x2 and x4 are the
free variables.

There is no need to continue to ﬁnd the row canonical form of M, because the echelon form already tells us that
the system has no solution. Speciﬁcally, the third row of the echelon matrix corresponds to the degenerate
equation

0x1 þ 0x2 þ 0x3 þ 0x4 ¼ 5
which has no solution. Thus, the system has no solution.

Thus, the system has the unique solution x ¼ 2, y ¼ 1, z ¼ 3, or, equivalently, the vector u ¼ ð2; 1; 3Þ. We
note that the echelon form of M already indicated that the solution was unique, because it corresponded to a
triangular system.

Application to Existence and Uniqueness Theorems
This subsection gives theoretical conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution of a system of
linear equations using the notion of the rank of a matrix.
THEOREM 3.9: Consider a system of linear equations in n unknowns with augmented matrix

M ¼ ½A; B. Then,

(a) The system has a solution if and only if rankðAÞ ¼ rankðMÞ.
(b) The solution is unique if and only if rankðAÞ ¼ rankðMÞ ¼ n.
Proof of (a). The system has a solution if and only if an echelon form of M ¼ ½A; B does not have a
row of the form
ð0; 0; . . . ; 0; bÞ;

with

b 6¼ 0

If an echelon form of M does have such a row, then b is a pivot of M but not of A, and hence,
rankðMÞ > rankðAÞ. Otherwise, the echelon forms of A and M have the same pivots, and hence,
rankðAÞ ¼ rankðMÞ. This proves (a).
Proof of (b). The system has a unique solution if and only if an echelon form has no free variable. This
means there is a pivot for each unknown. Accordingly, n ¼ rankðAÞ ¼ rankðMÞ. This proves (b).
The above proof uses the fact (Problem 3.74) that an echelon form of the augmented matrix
M ¼ ½A; B also automatically yields an echelon form of A.

where A ¼ ½aij  is the coefﬁcient matrix, X ¼ ½xj  is the column vector of unknowns, and B ¼ ½bi  is the
column vector of constants. (Some texts write Ax ¼ b rather than AX ¼ B, in order to emphasize that x
and b are simply column vectors.)
The statement that the system of linear equations and the matrix equation are equivalent means that
any vector solution of the system is a solution of the matrix equation, and vice versa.
The following system of linear equations and matrix equation are equivalent:

EXAMPLE 3.13

We note that x1 ¼ 3, x2 ¼ 1, x3 ¼ 2, x4 ¼ 1, or, in other words, the vector u ¼ ½3; 1; 2; 1 is a solution of
the system. Thus, the (column) vector u is also a solution of the matrix equation.

The matrix form AX ¼ B of a system of linear equations is notationally very convenient when
discussing and proving properties of systems of linear equations. This is illustrated with our ﬁrst theorem
(described in Fig. 3-1), which we restate for easy reference.
THEOREM 3.1: Suppose the ﬁeld K is inﬁnite. Then the system AX ¼ B has: (a) a unique solution, (b)

no solution, or (c) an inﬁnite number of solutions.
Proof. It sufﬁces to show that if AX ¼ B has more than one solution, then it has inﬁnitely many.
Suppose u and v are distinct solutions of AX ¼ B; that is, Au ¼ B and Av ¼ B. Then, for any k 2 K,
A½u þ kðu  vÞ ¼ Au þ kðAu  AvÞ ¼ B þ kðB  BÞ ¼ B
Thus, for each k 2 K, the vector u þ kðu  vÞ is a solution of AX ¼ B. Because all such solutions are
distinct (Problem 3.47), AX ¼ B has an inﬁnite number of solutions.
Observe that the above theorem is true when K is the real ﬁeld R (or the complex ﬁeld C). Section 3.3
shows that the theorem has a geometrical description when the system consists of two equations in two
unknowns, where each equation represents a line in R2 . The theorem also has a geometrical description
when the system consists of three nondegenerate equations in three unknowns, where the three equations
correspond to planes H1 , H2 , H3 in R3 . That is,
(a) Unique solution: Here the three planes intersect in exactly one point.
(b) No solution: Here the planes may intersect pairwise but with no common point of intersection, or two
of the planes may be parallel.
(c) Inﬁnite number of solutions: Here the three planes may intersect in a line (one free variable), or they
may coincide (two free variables).
These three cases are pictured in Fig. 3-3.

Matrix Equation of a Square System of Linear Equations
A system AX ¼ B of linear equations is square if and only if the matrix A of coefﬁcients is square. In such
a case, we have the following important result.

THEOREM 3.10: A square system AX ¼ B of linear equations has a unique solution if and only if the

matrix A is invertible. In such a case, A1 B is the unique solution of the system.

We only prove here that if A is invertible, then A1 B is a unique solution. If A is invertible, then
AðA1 BÞ ¼ ðAA1 ÞB ¼ IB ¼ B
and hence, A1 B is a solution. Now suppose v is any solution, so Av ¼ B. Then
v ¼ Iv ¼ ðA1 AÞv ¼ A1 ðAvÞ ¼ A1 B
Thus, the solution A1 B is unique.
Consider the following system of linear equations, whose coefﬁcient matrix A and
inverse A1 are also given:

Remark: We emphasize that Theorem 3.10 does not usually help us to ﬁnd the solution of a square
system. That is, ﬁnding the inverse of a coefﬁcient matrix A is not usually any easier than solving the
system directly. Thus, unless we are given the inverse of a coefﬁcient matrix A, as in Example 3.14,
we usually solve a square system by Gaussian elimination (or some iterative method whose discussion
lies beyond the scope of this text).

Recall that a vector v in K n is said to be a linear combination of vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um in K n if there exist
scalars a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; am in K such that
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ am um
Accordingly, the general system (3.2) of linear equations and the above equivalent vector equation have a
solution if and only if the column vector of constants is a linear combination of the columns of the
coefﬁcient matrix. We state this observation formally.
THEOREM 3.11: A system AX ¼ B of linear equations has a solution if and only if B is a linear

combination of the columns of the coefﬁcient matrix A.
Thus, the answer to the problem of expressing a given vector v in K n as a linear combination of vectors
u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um in K n reduces to solving a system of linear equations.

Linear Combination Example
Suppose we want to write the vector v ¼ ð1; 2; 5Þ as a linear combination of the vectors
u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ;

u2 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

u3 ¼ ð2; 1; 1Þ

First we write v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 with unknowns x; y; z, and then we ﬁnd the equivalent system of linear
equations which we solve. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst write

Setting corresponding entries equal to each other yields the following equivalent system:
x þ y þ 2z ¼

x þ 2y  z ¼ 2
x þ 3y þ z ¼

For notational convenience, we have written the vectors in Rn as columns, because it is then easier to ﬁnd
the equivalent system of linear equations. In fact, one can easily go from the vector equation (*) directly
to the system (**).
Now we solve the equivalent system of linear equations by reducing the system to echelon form. This
yields
x þ y þ 2z ¼ 1
y  3z ¼ 3
2y  z ¼ 4

and then

x þ y þ 2z ¼ 1
y  3z ¼ 3
5z ¼ 10

Back-substitution yields the solution x ¼ 6, y ¼ 3, z ¼ 2. Thus, v ¼ 6u1 þ 3u2 þ 2u3 .

(a) Write the vector v ¼ ð4; 9; 19Þ as a linear combination of

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

u2 ¼ ð3; 7; 10Þ;

u3 ¼ ð2; 1; 9Þ:

Find the equivalent system of linear equations by writing v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 , and reduce the system to an
echelon form. We have

x þ 3y þ 2z ¼ 4
2x  7y þ z ¼ 9

x þ 3y þ 2z ¼ 4

or

or

x þ 3y þ 2z ¼ 4
y þ 5z ¼ 17

Speciﬁcally, v ¼ 4u1  2u2 þ 3u3 .
(b) Write the vector v ¼ ð2; 3; 5Þ as a linear combination of

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

u2 ¼ ð2; 3; 4Þ;

u3 ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ

Find the equivalent system of linear equations by writing v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 , and reduce the system to an
echelon form. We have

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 2
2x þ 3y þ 3z ¼ 3
3x  4y  5z ¼ 5

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 2
y þ z ¼ 1
2y  2z ¼ 1

or

or

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 2
 5y þ 5z ¼ 1
0¼ 3

The system has no solution. Thus, it is impossible to write v as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 .

Linear Combinations of Orthogonal Vectors, Fourier Coefﬁcients
Recall ﬁrst (Section 1.4) that the dot (inner) product u  v of vectors u ¼ ða1 ; . . . ; an Þ and v ¼ ðb1 ; . . . ; bn Þ
in Rn is deﬁned by
u  v ¼ a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ    þ an bn
Furthermore, vectors u and v are said to be orthogonal if their dot product u  v ¼ 0.
Suppose that u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un in Rn are n nonzero pairwise orthogonal vectors. This means
ðiÞ ui  uj ¼ 0

for i 6¼ j

and

ðiiÞ ui  ui 6¼ 0

for each i

Then, for any vector v in Rn , there is an easy way to write v as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un ,
which is illustrated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 3.16

Consider the following three vectors in R3 :

u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ;

u2 ¼ ð1; 3; 2Þ;

u3 ¼ ð5; 1; 4Þ

These vectors are pairwise orthogonal; that is,

u1  u2 ¼ 1  3 þ 2 ¼ 0;

u1  u3 ¼ 5  1  4 ¼ 0;

u2  u3 ¼ 5 þ 3  8 ¼ 0

Suppose we want to write v ¼ ð4; 14; 9Þ as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 .

Method 1. Find the equivalent system of linear equations as in Example 3.14 and then solve,
obtaining v ¼ 3u1  4u2 þ u3 .
Method 2. (This method uses the fact that the vectors u1 ; u2 ; u3 are mutually orthogonal, and
hence, the arithmetic is much simpler.) Set v as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 using unknown scalars
x; y; z as follows:
ð4; 14; 9Þ ¼ xð1; 1; 1Þ þ yð1; 3; 2Þ þ zð5; 1; 4Þ

or

or

(The last two terms drop out, because u1 is orthogonal to u2 and to u3 .) Next take the dot product of (*) with respect
to u2 to obtain
ð4; 14; 9Þ  ð1; 3; 2Þ ¼ yð1; 3; 2Þ  ð1; 3; 2Þ

or

or

Thus, v ¼ 3u1  4u2 þ u3 .

The procedure in Method 2 in Example 3.16 is valid in general. Namely,
THEOREM 3.12: Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un are nonzero mutually orthogonal vectors in Rn . Then, for any

vector v in Rn ,
v  u1
v  u2
v  un
v¼
u þ
u þ  þ

u1  u1 1 u2  u2 2
un  un n

We emphasize that there must be n such orthogonal vectors ui in Rn for the formula to be used. Note
also that each ui  ui 6¼ 0, because each ui is a nonzero vector.
Remark: The following scalar ki (appearing in Theorem 3.12) is called the Fourier coefﬁcient of v
with respect to ui :
v  ui
v  ui
¼
ki ¼
ui  ui kui k2
It is analogous to a coefﬁcient in the celebrated Fourier series of a function.

Homogeneous Systems of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations is said to be homogeneous if all the constant terms are zero. Thus, a
homogeneous system has the form AX ¼ 0. Clearly, such a system always has the zero vector
0 ¼ ð0; 0; . . . ; 0Þ as a solution, called the zero or trivial solution. Accordingly, we are usually interested
in whether or not the system has a nonzero solution.
Because a homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 has at least the zero solution, it can always be put in an
echelon form, say
a11 x1 þ a12 x2 þ a13 x3 þ a14 x4 þ    þ a1n xn ¼ 0
a2j2 xj2 þ a2;j2 þ1 xj2 þ1 þ    þ a2n xn ¼ 0
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
arjr xjr þ    þ arn xn ¼ 0
Here r denotes the number of equations in echelon form and n denotes the number of unknowns. Thus,
the echelon system has n  r free variables.
The question of nonzero solutions reduces to the following two cases:
(i) r ¼ n. The system has only the zero solution.
(ii) r < n. The system has a nonzero solution.
Accordingly, if we begin with fewer equations than unknowns, then, in echelon form, r < n, and the
system has a nonzero solution. This proves the following important result.
THEOREM 3.13: A homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 with more unknowns than equations has a nonzero

solution.

82

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

EXAMPLE 3.17

Determine whether or not each of the following homogeneous systems has a nonzero

solution:
xþ y z¼0
2x  3y þ z ¼ 0
x  4y þ 2z ¼ 0
(a)

xþ y z¼0
2x þ 4y  z ¼ 0
3x þ 2y þ 2z ¼ 0
(b)

x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 0
2x1  3x2 þ 5x3  7x4 ¼ 0
5x1 þ 6x2  9x3 þ 8x4 ¼ 0
(c)

(a) Reduce the system to echelon form as follows:

xþ y z¼0
5y þ 3z ¼ 0
5y þ 3z ¼ 0

and then

xþ y z¼0
5y þ 3z ¼ 0

The system has a nonzero solution, because there are only two equations in the three unknowns in echelon form.
Here z is a free variable. Let us, say, set z ¼ 5. Then, by back-substitution, y ¼ 3 and x ¼ 2. Thus, the vector
u ¼ ð2; 3; 5Þ is a particular nonzero solution.
(b) Reduce the system to echelon form as follows:

xþy z¼0
2y þ z ¼ 0
y þ 5z ¼ 0

and then

xþyz¼0
2y þ z ¼ 0
11z ¼ 0

In echelon form, there are three equations in three unknowns. Thus, the system has only the zero solution.
(c) The system must have a nonzero solution (Theorem 3.13), because there are four unknowns but only three
equations. (Here we do not need to reduce the system to echelon form.)

Basis for the General Solution of a Homogeneous System
Let W denote the general solution of a homogeneous system AX ¼ 0. A list of nonzero solution vectors
u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; us of the system is said to be a basis for W if each solution vector w 2 W can be expressed
uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; us ; that is, there exist unique scalars
a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; as such that
w ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ as us
The number s of such basis vectors is equal to the number of free variables. This number s is called the
dimension of W , written as dim W ¼ s. When W ¼ f0g—that is, the system has only the zero solution—
we deﬁne dim W ¼ 0.
The following theorem, proved in Chapter 5, page 171, tells us how to ﬁnd such a basis.
THEOREM 3.14: Let W be the general solution of a homogeneous system AX ¼ 0, and suppose that

the echelon form of the homogeneous system has s free variables. Let u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; us
be the solutions obtained by setting one of the free variables equal to 1 (or any
nonzero constant) and the remaining free variables equal to 0. Then dim W ¼ s, and
the vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; us form a basis of W .

We emphasize that the general solution W may have many bases, and that Theorem 3.12 only gives us
one such basis.
EXAMPLE 3.18 Find the dimension and a basis for the general solution W of the homogeneous system

x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ 2x4  4x5 ¼ 0
2x1 þ 4x2  5x3 þ x4  6x5 ¼ 0
5x1 þ 10x2  13x3 þ 4x4  16x5 ¼ 0

83

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
First reduce the system to echelon form. Apply the following operations:

‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 ’’

and ‘‘Replace L3 by  5L1 þ L3 ’’

and then ‘‘Replace L3 by 2L2 þ L3 ’’

These operations yield

x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ 2x4  4x5 ¼ 0
x3  3x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 0
2x3  6x4 þ 4x5 ¼ 0

x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ 2x4  4x5 ¼ 0
x3  3x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 0

and

The system in echelon form has three free variables, x2 ; x4 ; x5 ; hence, dim W ¼ 3. Three solution vectors that form a
basis for W are obtained as follows:
(1) Set x2 ¼ 1, x4 ¼ 0, x5 ¼ 0. Back-substitution yields the solution u1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ.
(2) Set x2 ¼ 0, x4 ¼ 1, x5 ¼ 0. Back-substitution yields the solution u2 ¼ ð7; 0; 3; 1; 0Þ.
(3) Set x2 ¼ 0, x4 ¼ 0, x5 ¼ 1. Back-substitution yields the solution u3 ¼ ð2; 0; 2; 0; 1Þ.
The vectors

u1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ,

u2 ¼ ð7; 0; 3; 1; 0Þ,

u3 ¼ ð2; 0; 2; 0; 1Þ form a basis for W .

Remark: Any solution of the system in Example 3.18 can be written in the form
au1 þ bu2 þ cu3 ¼ að2; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ þ bð7; 0; 3; 1; 0Þ þ cð2; 0; 2; 0; 1Þ

3b  2c;

b;

or
x1 ¼ 2a þ 7b  2c;

x2 ¼ a;

x3 ¼ 3b  2c;

x4 ¼ b;

x5 ¼ c

where a; b; c are arbitrary constants. Observe that this representation is nothing more than the parametric
form of the general solution under the choice of parameters x2 ¼ a, x4 ¼ b, x5 ¼ c.

Nonhomogeneous and Associated Homogeneous Systems
Let AX ¼ B be a nonhomogeneous system of linear equations. Then AX ¼ 0 is called the associated
homogeneous system. For example,
x þ 2y  4z ¼ 7
3x  5y þ 6z ¼ 8

and

x þ 2y  4z ¼ 0
3x  5y þ 6z ¼ 0

show a nonhomogeneous system and its associated homogeneous system.
The relationship between the solution U of a nonhomogeneous system AX ¼ B and the solution W of
its associated homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 is contained in the following theorem.
THEOREM 3.15: Let v 0 be a particular solution of AX ¼ B and let W be the general solution of

AX ¼ 0. Then the following is the general solution of AX ¼ B:
U ¼ v 0 þ W ¼ fv 0 þ w : w 2 W g

That is, U ¼ v 0 þ W is obtained by adding v 0 to each element in W . We note that this theorem has a
geometrical interpretation in R3 . Speciﬁcally, suppose W is a line through the origin O. Then, as pictured
in Fig. 3-4, U ¼ v 0 þ W is the line parallel to W obtained by adding v 0 to each element of W . Similarly,
whenever W is a plane through the origin O, then U ¼ v 0 þ W is a plane parallel to W .

Elementary Matrices

Let e denote an elementary row operation and let eðAÞ denote the results of applying the operation e to a
matrix A. Now let E be the matrix obtained by applying e to the identity matrix I; that is,
E ¼ eðIÞ
Then E is called the elementary matrix corresponding to the elementary row operation e. Note that E is
always a square matrix.
EXAMPLE 3.19

Consider the following three elementary row operations:

ð1Þ Interchange R2 and R3 :
The 3

ð2Þ Replace R2 by 6R2 :

ð3Þ Replace R3 by  4R1 þ R3 :

THEOREM 3.16: Let e be an elementary row operation and let E be the corresponding m

m

elementary matrix. Then
eðAÞ ¼ EA
where A is any m

n matrix.

In other words, the result of applying an elementary row operation e to a matrix A can be obtained by
premultiplying A by the corresponding elementary matrix E.
Now suppose e0 is the inverse of an elementary row operation e, and let E0 and E be the corresponding
matrices. We note (Problem 3.33) that E is invertible and E0 is its inverse. This means, in particular, that
any product
P ¼ Ek . . . E2 E1
of elementary matrices is invertible.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Applications of Elementary Matrices
Using Theorem 3.16, we are able to prove (Problem 3.35) the following important properties of matrices.
THEOREM 3.17: Let A be a square matrix. Then the following are equivalent:

(a)

A is invertible (nonsingular).

(b)

A is row equivalent to the identity matrix I.

(c)

A is a product of elementary matrices.

Recall that square matrices A and B are inverses if AB ¼ BA ¼ I. The next theorem (proved in
Problem 3.36) demonstrates that we need only show that one of the products is true, say AB ¼ I, to prove
that matrices are inverses.
THEOREM 3.18: Suppose AB ¼ I. Then BA ¼ I, and hence, B ¼ A1 .

Row equivalence can also be deﬁned in terms of matrix multiplication. Speciﬁcally, we will prove
(Problem 3.37) the following.
THEOREM 3.19: B is row equivalent to A if and only if there exists a nonsingular matrix P such that

B ¼ PA.

Application to Finding the Inverse of an n

n Matrix

The following algorithm ﬁnds the inverse of a matrix.
ALGORITHM 3.5: The input is a square matrix A. The output is the inverse of A or that the inverse

does not exist.
Step 1.

Form the n 2n (block) matrix M ¼ ½A; I, where A is the left half of M and the identity matrix
I is the right half of M.

Step 2. Row reduce M to echelon form. If the process generates a zero row in the A half of M, then
STOP
A has no inverse. (Otherwise A is in triangular form.)
Step 3. Further row reduce M to its row canonical form
M

½I; B

where the identity matrix I has replaced A in the left half of M.
Step 4. Set A1 ¼ B, the matrix that is now in the right half of M.
The justiﬁcation for the above algorithm is as follows. Suppose A is invertible and, say, the sequence
of elementary row operations e1 ; e2 ; . . . ; eq applied to M ¼ ½A; I reduces the left half of M, which is A, to
the identity matrix I. Let Ei be the elementary matrix corresponding to the operation ei . Then, by
applying Theorem 3.16. we get
Eq . . . E2 E1 A ¼ I

ðEq . . . E2 E1 IÞA ¼ I;

or

so

A1 ¼ Eq . . . E2 E1 I

That is, A1 can be obtained by applying the elementary row operations e1 ; e2 ; . . . ; eq to the identity
matrix I, which appears in the right half of M. Thus, B ¼ A1 , as claimed.

Elementary Column Operations
Now let A be a matrix with columns C1 ; C2 ; . . . ; Cn . The following operations on A, analogous to the
elementary row operations, are called elementary column operations:
½F1  (Column Interchange): Interchange columns Ci and Cj .
½F2  (Column Scaling): Replace Ci by kCi (where k 6¼ 0).
½F3  (Column Addition): Replace Cj by kCi þ Cj .
We may indicate each of the column operations by writing, respectively,
ð1Þ Ci $ Cj ;

ð2Þ kCi ! Ci ;

ð3Þ ðkCi þ Cj Þ ! Cj

Moreover, each column operation has an inverse operation of the same type, just like the corresponding
row operation.
Now let f denote an elementary column operation, and let F be the matrix obtained by applying f to
the identity matrix I; that is,
F ¼ f ðIÞ
Then F is called the elementary matrix corresponding to the elementary column operation f . Note that F
is always a square matrix.

That is, the result of applying an elementary column operation f on a matrix A can be obtained by
postmultiplying A by the corresponding elementary matrix F.

Matrix Equivalence
A matrix B is equivalent to a matrix A if B can be obtained from A by a sequence of row and column
operations. Alternatively, B is equivalent to A, if there exist nonsingular matrices P and Q such that
B ¼ PAQ. Just like row equivalence, equivalence of matrices is an equivalence relation.
The main result of this subsection (proved in Problem 3.38) is as follows.
THEOREM 3.21: Every m



n matrix A is equivalent to a unique block matrix of the form

Ir 0
0 0

where Ir is the r-square identity matrix.
The following deﬁnition applies.
DEFINITION: The nonnegative integer r in Theorem 3.18 is called the rank of A, written rankðAÞ.
Note that this deﬁnition agrees with the previous deﬁnition of the rank of a matrix.

3.13

LU DECOMPOSITION

Suppose A is a nonsingular matrix that can be brought into (upper) triangular form U using only rowaddition operations; that is, suppose A can be triangularized by the following algorithm, which we write
using computer notation.
ALGORITHM 3.6: The input is a matrix A and the output is a triangular matrix U .

Step 1. Repeat for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n  1:
Repeat for j ¼ i þ 1, i þ 2; . . . ; n

Step 2.

(a) Set mij : ¼ aij =aii .
(b) Set Rj : ¼ mij Ri þ Rj
[End of Step 2 inner loop.]
[End of Step 1 outer loop.]
The numbers mij are called multipliers. Sometimes we keep track of these multipliers by means of the
following lower triangular matrix L:

That is, L has 1’s on the diagonal, 0’s above the diagonal, and the negative of the multiplier mij as its
ij-entry below the diagonal.
The above matrix L and the triangular matrix U obtained in Algorithm 3.6 give us the classical LU
factorization of such a matrix A. Namely,
THEOREM 3.22: Let A be a nonsingular matrix that can be brought into triangular form U using only

row-addition operations. Then A ¼ LU , where L is the above lower triangular matrix
with 1’s on the diagonal, and U is an upper triangular matrix with no 0’s on the
diagonal.

Application to Systems of Linear Equations
Consider a computer algorithm M. Let CðnÞ denote the running time of the algorithm as a function of the
size n of the input data. [The function CðnÞ is sometimes called the time complexity or simply the
complexity of the algorithm M.] Frequently, CðnÞ simply counts the number of multiplications and
divisions executed by M, but does not count the number of additions and subtractions because they take
much less time to execute.
Now consider a square system of linear equations AX ¼ B, where
A ¼ ½aij ;

X ¼ ½x1 ; . . . ; xn T ;

B ¼ ½b1 ; . . . ; bn T

and suppose A has an LU factorization. Then the system can be brought into triangular form (in order to
apply back-substitution) by applying Algorithm 3.6 to the augmented matrix M ¼ ½A; B of the system.
The time complexity of Algorithm 3.6 and back-substitution are, respectively,
CðnÞ

1 3
2n

and

CðnÞ

1 2

where n is the number of equations.
On the other hand, suppose we already have the factorization A ¼ LU . Then, to triangularize the
system, we need only apply the row operations in the algorithm (retained by the matrix L) to the column
vector B. In this case, the time complexity is
CðnÞ

1 2
2n

Of course, to obtain the factorization A ¼ LU requires the original algorithm where CðnÞ 12 n3 . Thus,
nothing may be gained by ﬁrst ﬁnding the LU factorization when a single system is involved. However,
there are situations, illustrated below, where the LU factorization is useful.
Suppose, for a given matrix A, we need to solve the system
AX ¼ B

89

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

repeatedly for a sequence of different constant vectors, say B1 ; B2 ; . . . ; Bk . Also, suppose some of the Bi
depend upon the solution of the system obtained while using preceding vectors Bj . In such a case, it is
more efﬁcient to ﬁrst ﬁnd the LU factorization of A, and then to use this factorization to solve the system
for each new B.
Consider the following system of linear equations:

x þ 2y þ z ¼ k1

B1 ¼ ½1; 1; 1T , and suppose
ðfor j ¼ 1; 2Þ
Bjþ1 ¼ Bj þ Xj
where Xj is the solution of AX ¼ Bj . Here it is more efﬁcient to ﬁrst obtain the LU factorization of A and then use the
LU factorization to solve the system for each of the B’s. (This is done in Problem 3.42.)

(b) Substitute to obtain 1 þ 2ð2Þ  4ð4Þ þ 3ð5Þ ¼ 15, or 4 ¼ 15; no, it is not a solution.

Solve (a)

ex ¼ p,

(b) 3x  4  x ¼ 2x þ 3,

(c)

7 þ 2x  4 ¼ 3x þ 3  x

(a) Because e 6¼ 0, multiply by 1=e to obtain x ¼ p=e.
(b) Rewrite in standard form, obtaining 0x ¼ 7. The equation has no solution.
(c) Rewrite in standard form, obtaining 0x ¼ 0. Every scalar k is a solution.

3.4.

Prove Theorem 3.4: Consider the equation ax ¼ b.
(i) If a 6¼ 0, then x ¼ b=a is a unique solution of ax ¼ b.

(ii) If a ¼ 0 but b 6¼ 0, then ax ¼ b has no solution.
(iii) If a ¼ 0 and b ¼ 0, then every scalar k is a solution of ax ¼ b.
Suppose a 6¼ 0. Then the scalar b=a exists. Substituting b=a in ax ¼ b yields aðb=aÞ ¼ b, or b ¼ b;
hence, b=a is a solution. On the other hand, suppose x0 is a solution to ax ¼ b, so that ax0 ¼ b. Multiplying
both sides by 1=a yields x0 ¼ b=a. Hence, b=a is the unique solution of ax ¼ b. Thus, (i) is proved.
On the other hand, suppose a ¼ 0. Then, for any scalar k, we have ak ¼ 0k ¼ 0. If b 6¼ 0, then ak 6¼ b.
Accordingly, k is not a solution of ax ¼ b, and so (ii) is proved. If b ¼ 0, then ak ¼ b. That is, any scalar k is
a solution of ax ¼ b, and so (iii) is proved.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
Solve each of the following systems:
2x  5y ¼ 11
2x  3y ¼ 8
(a)
(b)
6x þ 9y ¼ 6
3x þ 4y ¼ 5

2x  3y ¼
8
4x þ 6y ¼ 16

(c)

(a) Eliminate x from the equations by forming the new equation L ¼ 3L1 þ 2L2 . This yields the equation

23y ¼ 23;

y ¼ 1

and so

Substitute y ¼ 1 in one of the original equations, say L1 , to get
2x  5ð1Þ ¼ 11

2x þ 5 ¼ 11

or

2x ¼ 6

or

or

x¼3

Thus, x ¼ 3, y ¼ 1 or the pair u ¼ ð3; 1Þ is the unique solution of the system.
(b) Eliminate x from the equations by forming the new equation L ¼ 3L1 þ L2 . This yields the equation

0x þ 0y ¼ 30
This is a degenerate equation with a nonzero constant; hence, this equation and the system have no
solution. (Geometrically, the lines corresponding to the equations are parallel.)
(c) Eliminate x from the equations by forming the new equation L ¼ 2L1 þ L2 . This yields the equation
0x þ 0y ¼ 0
This is a degenerate equation where the constant term is also zero. Thus, the system has an inﬁnite
number of solutions, which correspond to the solution of either equation. (Geometrically, the lines
corresponding to the equations coincide.)
To ﬁnd the general solution, set y ¼ a and substitute in L1 to obtain
2x  3a ¼ 8

or

2x ¼ 3a þ 8

or

x ¼ 32 a þ 4

Thus, the general solution is
x ¼ 32 a þ 4;

y¼a

or

u¼

2 a þ 4;

where a is any scalar.

3.6.

Consider the system
x þ ay ¼ 4
ax þ 9y ¼ b
(a) For which values of a does the system have a unique solution?
(b) Find those pairs of values (a; b) for which the system has more than one solution.
(a) Eliminate x from the equations by forming the new equation L ¼ aL1 þ L2 . This yields the equation

ð9  a2 Þy ¼ b  4a
ð1Þ
The system has a unique solution if and only if the coefﬁcient of y in (1) is not zero—that is, if
9  a2 6¼ 0 or if a 6¼ 3.
(b) The system has more than one solution if both sides of (1) are zero. The left-hand side is zero when
a ¼ 3. When a ¼ 3, the right-hand side is zero when b  12 ¼ 0 or b ¼ 12. When a ¼ 3, the righthand side is zero when b þ 12  0 or b ¼ 12. Thus, (3; 12) and ð3; 12Þ are the pairs for which the
system has more than one solution.

Systems in Triangular and Echelon Form
3.7.

Determine the pivot and free variables in each of the following systems:
2x1  3x2  6x3  5x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 7
x3 þ 3x4  7x5 ¼ 6
x4  2x5 ¼ 1
(a)

2x  6y þ 7z ¼ 1
4y þ 3z ¼ 8
2z ¼ 4
(b)

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 2
2x þ 3y þ z ¼ 4
3x þ 4y þ 5z ¼ 8
(c)

(a) In echelon form, the leading unknowns are the pivot variables, and the others are the free variables. Here
x1 , x3 , x4 are the pivot variables, and x2 and x5 are the free variables.

91

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

(b) The leading unknowns are x; y; z, so they are the pivot variables. There are no free variables (as in any
triangular system).
(c) The notion of pivot and free variables applies only to a system in echelon form.

3.8.

Solve the triangular system in Problem 3.7(b).
Because it is a triangular system, solve by back-substitution.
(i) The last equation gives z ¼ 2.
(ii) Substitute z ¼ 2 in the second equation to get 4y þ 6 ¼ 8 or y ¼ 12.
(iii) Substitute z ¼ 2 and y ¼ 12 in the ﬁrst equation to get
 
1
þ 7ð2Þ ¼ 1
or
2x þ 11 ¼ 1
or
2x  6

Thus,

3.9.

x ¼ 5

x ¼ 5, y ¼ 12, z ¼ 2 or u ¼ ð5; 12 ; 2Þ is the unique solution to the system.

Solve the echelon system in Problem 3.7(a).

Assign parameters to the free variables, say x2 ¼ a and x5 ¼ b, and solve for the pivot variables by backsubstitution.
(i) Substitute x5 ¼ b in the last equation to get x4  2b ¼ 1 or x4 ¼ 2b þ 1.
(ii) Substitute x5 ¼ b and x4 ¼ 2b þ 1 in the second equation to get
x3 þ 3ð2b þ 1Þ  7b ¼ 6
(iii)

or

x3  b þ 3 ¼ 6

or

x3 ¼ b þ 3

Substitute x5 ¼ b, x4 ¼ 2b þ 1, x3 ¼ b þ 3, x2 ¼ a in the ﬁrst equation to get
2x1  3a  6ðb þ 3Þ  5ð2b þ 1Þ þ 2b ¼ 7
or

or

2x1  3a  14b  23 ¼ 7

x1 ¼ 32 a þ 7b þ 15

Thus,
3
x2 ¼ a;
x1 ¼ a þ 7b þ 15;
x3 ¼ b þ 3;
x4 ¼ 2b þ 1; x5 ¼ b

is the parametric form of the general solution.
Alternatively, solving for the pivot variable x1 ; x3 ; x4 in terms of the free variables x2 and x5 yields the
following free-variable form of the general solution:
3
x1 ¼ x2 þ 7x5 þ 15;
2

x3 ¼ x5 þ 3;

x4 ¼ 2x5 þ 1

3.10. Prove Theorem 3.6. Consider the system (3.4) of linear equations in echelon form with r equations
and n unknowns.
(i) If r ¼ n, then the system has a unique solution.

(ii) If r < n, then we can arbitrarily assign values to the n  r free variable and solve uniquely for
the r pivot variables, obtaining a solution of the system.
(i) Suppose r ¼ n. Then we have a square system AX ¼ B where the matrix A of coefﬁcients is (upper)
triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. Thus, A is invertible. By Theorem 3.10, the system has a
unique solution.
(ii) Assigning values to the n  r free variables yields a triangular system in the pivot variables, which, by
(i), has a unique solution.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Gaussian Elimination
3.11. Solve each of the following systems:
x þ 2y  4z ¼ 4
2x þ 5y  9z ¼ 10
3x  2y þ 3z ¼ 11
(a)

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
3x þ y  2z ¼ 7
5x þ 3y  4z ¼ 2
(b)

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
2x þ 5y  8z ¼ 4
3x þ 8y  13z ¼ 7
(c)

Reduce each system to triangular or echelon form using Gaussian elimination:
(a) Apply ‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 ’’ and ‘‘Replace L3 by 3L1 þ L3 ’’ to eliminate x from the second and
third equations, and then apply ‘‘Replace L3 by 8L2 þ L3 ’’ to eliminate y from the third equation. These
operations yield
x þ 2y  4z ¼ 4
y  z ¼ 2
8y þ 15z ¼ 23

x þ 2y  4z ¼ 4
y  z ¼ 2
7z ¼ 7

and then

The system is in triangular form. Solve by back-substitution to obtain the unique solution
u ¼ ð2; 1; 1Þ.
(b) Eliminate x from the second and third equations by the operations ‘‘Replace L2 by 3L1 þ L2 ’’ and
‘‘Replace L3 by 5L1 þ L3 .’’ This gives the equivalent system
x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
7y  11z ¼ 10
7y þ 11z ¼
7
The operation ‘‘Replace L3 by L2 þ L3 ’’ yields the following degenerate equation with a nonzero
constant:
0x þ 0y þ 0z ¼ 3
This equation and hence the system have no solution.
(c) Eliminate x from the second and third equations by the operations ‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 ’’ and
‘‘Replace L3 by 3L1 þ L3 .’’ This yields the new system
x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
y  2z ¼ 2
2y  4z ¼ 4

x þ 2y  3z ¼ 1
y  2z ¼ 2

or

(The third equation is deleted, because it is a multiple of the second equation.) The system is in echelon
form with pivot variables x and y and free variable z.
To ﬁnd the parametric form of the general solution, set z ¼ a and solve for x and y by backsubstitution. Substitute z ¼ a in the second equation to get y ¼ 2 þ 2a. Then substitute z ¼ a and
y ¼ 2 þ 2a in the ﬁrst equation to get
x þ 2ð2 þ 2aÞ  3a ¼ 1

or

xþ4þa¼1

or

x ¼ 3  a

Thus, the general solution is
x ¼ 3  a;

y ¼ 2 þ 2a;

z¼a

or

u ¼ ð3  a;

2 þ 2a;

aÞ

where a is a parameter.

3.12. Solve each of the following systems:
x1  3x2 þ 2x3  x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 2
3x1  9x2 þ 7x3  x4 þ 3x5 ¼ 7
2x1  6x2 þ 7x3 þ 4x4  5x5 ¼ 7
(a)

x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 2
2x1 þ 5x2  2x3 þ x4 ¼ 1
5x1 þ 12x2  7x3 þ 6x4 ¼ 3
(b)

Reduce each system to echelon form using Gaussian elimination:

93

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

(a) Apply ‘‘Replace L2 by 3L1 þ L2 ’’ and ‘‘Replace L3 by 2L1 þ L3 ’’ to eliminate x from the second and
third equations. This yields

x1  3x2 þ 2x3  x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 2
x3 þ 2x4  3x5 ¼ 1
3x3 þ 6x4  9x5 ¼ 3

or

x1  3x2 þ 2x3  x4 þ 2x5 ¼ 2
x3 þ 2x4  3x5 ¼ 1

(We delete L3 , because it is a multiple of L2 .) The system is in echelon form with pivot variables x1 and
x3 and free variables x2 ; x4 ; x5 .
To ﬁnd the parametric form of the general solution, set x2 ¼ a, x4 ¼ b, x5 ¼ c, where a; b; c are
parameters. Back-substitution yields x3 ¼ 1  2b þ 3c and x1 ¼ 3a þ 5b  8c. The general solution is
x1 ¼ 3a þ 5b  8c; x2 ¼ a; x3 ¼ 1  2b þ 3c; x4 ¼ b; x5 ¼ c
or, equivalently, u ¼ ð3a þ 5b  8c; a; 1  2b þ 3c; b; cÞ.
(b) Eliminate x1 from the second and third equations by the operations ‘‘Replace L2 by 2L1 þ L2 ’’ and
‘‘Replace L3 by 5L1 þ L3 .’’ This yields the system
x1 þ 2x2  3x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 2
x2 þ 4x3  7x4 ¼ 3
2x2 þ 8x3  14x4 ¼ 7
The operation ‘‘Replace L3 by 2L2 þ L3 ’’ yields the degenerate equation 0 ¼ 1. Thus, the system
has no solution (even though the system has more unknowns than equations).

3.13. Solve using the condensed format:
2y þ 3z ¼ 3
xþ yþ z¼ 4
4x þ 8y  3z ¼ 35
The condensed format follows:
ð2Þ

ð300 Þ

Equation
2y þ 3z ¼ 3

4y  7z ¼ 19
 13z ¼ 13

Operation
L1 $ L2
L1 $ L2
Replace L3 by  4L1 þ L3
Replace L3 by  2L2 þ L3

Here (1), (2), and (300 ) form a triangular system. (We emphasize that the interchange of L1 and L2 is
accomplished by simply renumbering L1 and L2 as above.)
Using back-substitution with the triangular system yields z ¼ 1 from L3 , y ¼ 3 from L2 , and x ¼ 2
from L1 . Thus, the unique solution of the system is x ¼ 2, y ¼ 3, z ¼ 1 or the triple u ¼ ð2; 3; 1Þ.

3.14. Consider the system
x þ 2y þ z ¼ 3
ay þ 5z ¼ 10
2x þ 7y þ az ¼ b
(a) Find those values of a for which the system has a unique solution.

(b) Find those pairs of values ða; bÞ for which the system has more than one solution.
Reduce the system to echelon form. That is, eliminate x from the third equation by the operation
‘‘Replace L3 by 2L1 þ L3 ’’ and then eliminate y from the third equation by the operation

and then

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 3

ða2  2a  15Þz ¼ ab  6a  30

Examine the last equation ða2  2a  15Þz ¼ ab  6a  30.
(a) The system has a unique solution if and only if the coefﬁcient of z is not zero; that is, if
a2  2a  15 ¼ ða  5Þða þ 3Þ 6¼ 0

or

a 6¼ 5 and

a 6¼ 3:

(b) The system has more than one solution if both sides are zero. The left-hand side is zero when a ¼ 5 or
a ¼ 3. When a ¼ 5, the right-hand side is zero when 5b  60 ¼ 0, or b ¼ 12. When a ¼ 3, the righthand side is zero when 3b  12 ¼ 0, or b ¼ 4. Thus, ð5; 12Þ and ð3; 4Þ are the pairs for which the
system has more than one solution.

(a) A ¼ 4 2 4 2 2 5;

(a) Use a11 ¼ 1 as a pivot to obtain 0’s below a11 ; that is, apply the row operations ‘‘Replace R2 by
2R1 þ R2 ’’ and ‘‘Replace R3 by 3R1 þ R3 :’’ Then use a23 ¼ 4 as a pivot to obtain a 0 below a23 ; that
is, apply the row operation ‘‘Replace R3 by 5R2 þ 4R3 .’’ These operations yield

Next apply the operations ‘‘Replace R2 by 4R1 þ R2 ’’ and ‘‘Replace R3 by 6R1 þ R3 ’’; and then apply
the operation ‘‘Replace R3 by R2 þ R3 .’’ These operations yield

3.16. Describe the pivoting row-reduction algorithm. Also describe the advantages, if any, of using this
pivoting algorithm.
The row-reduction algorithm becomes a pivoting algorithm if the entry in column j of greatest absolute
value is chosen as the pivot a1j1 and if one uses the row operation
ðaij1 =a1j1 ÞR1 þ Ri ! Ri
The main advantage of the pivoting algorithm is that the above row operation involves division by the
(current) pivot a1j1 , and, on the computer, roundoff errors may be substantially reduced when one divides by
a number as large in absolute value as possible.

(a) First reduce A to echelon form by applying the operations ‘‘Replace R2 by 2R1 þ R2 ’’ and ‘‘Replace R3

Now use back-substitution on the echelon matrix to obtain the row canonical form of A. Speciﬁcally,
ﬁrst multiply R3 by 14 to obtain the pivot a34 ¼ 1, and then apply the operations ‘‘Replace R2 by

The last matrix, which is the identity matrix I, is the row canonical form of B. (This is expected, because
B is invertible, and so its row canonical form must be I.)

3.19. Describe the Gauss–Jordan elimination algorithm, which also row reduces an arbitrary matrix A to
its row canonical form.

96

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
The Gauss–Jordan algorithm is similar in some ways to the Gaussian elimination algorithm, except that
here each pivot is used to place 0’s both below and above the pivot, not just below the pivot, before working
with the next pivot. Also, one variation of the algorithm ﬁrst normalizes each row—that is, obtains a unit
pivot—before it is used to produce 0’s in the other rows, rather than normalizing the rows at the end of the
algorithm.

(The third row of the second matrix is deleted, because it is a multiple of the second row and will result

the free variables to the other side to obtain the free-variable form of the solution:
x ¼ 10z
x þ 10z ¼ 0
and
y ¼ 1 þ 7z
y  7z ¼ 1
Here z is the only free variable. The parametric solution, using z ¼ a, is as follows:

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
Here x1 ; x2 ; x4 are the pivot variables and x3 and x5 are the free variables. Recall that the parametric form of
the solution can be obtained from the free-variable form of the solution by simply setting the free variables
equal to parameters, say x3 ¼ a, x5 ¼ b. This process yields
or

x1 ¼ 21  a  24b; x2 ¼ 7 þ 2a þ 8b; x3 ¼ a; x4 ¼ 3  2b; x5 ¼ b
u ¼ ð21  a  24b; 7 þ 2a þ 8b; a; 3  2b; bÞ

which is another form of the solution.

Linear Combinations, Homogeneous Systems
3.24. Write v as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 , where
(a) v ¼ ð3; 10; 7Þ and u1 ¼ ð1; 3; 2Þ; u2 ¼ ð1; 4; 2Þ; u3 ¼ ð2; 8; 1Þ;

(b) v ¼ ð2; 7; 10Þ and u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, u2 ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ, u3 ¼ ð1; 5; 9Þ;
(c) v ¼ ð1; 5; 4Þ and u1 ¼ ð1; 3; 2Þ, u2 ¼ ð2; 7; 1Þ, u3 ¼ ð1; 6; 7Þ.
Find the equivalent system of linear equations by writing v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 . Alternatively, use the
augmented matrix M of the equivalent system, where M ¼ ½u1 ; u2 ; u3 ; v. (Here u1 ; u2 ; u3 ; v are the columns
of M.)
(a) The vector equation v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 for the given vectors is as follows:

Form the equivalent system of linear equations by setting corresponding entries equal to each other, and
then reduce the system to echelon form:
x þ y þ 2z ¼ 3
3x þ 4y þ 8z ¼ 10
2x þ 2y þ z ¼ 7

x þ y þ 2z ¼ 3
y þ 2z ¼ 1
4y þ 5z ¼ 13

or

or

x þ y þ 2z ¼ 3
y þ 2z ¼ 1
3z ¼ 9

The system is in triangular form. Back-substitution yields the unique solution x ¼ 2, y ¼ 7, z ¼ 3.
Thus, v ¼ 2u1 þ 7u2  3u3 .
Alternatively, form the augmented matrix M ¼ [u1 ; u2 ; u3 ; v] of the equivalent system, and reduce
M to echelon form:

The last matrix corresponds to a triangular system that has a unique solution. Back-substitution yields
the solution x ¼ 2, y ¼ 7, z ¼ 3. Thus, v ¼ 2u1 þ 7u2  3u3 .
(b) Form the augmented matrix M ¼ ½u1 ; u2 ; u3 ; v of the equivalent system, and reduce M to the echelon
form:

the system also has no solution, and v cannot be written as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 .

The last matrix corresponds to the following system with free variable z:
x þ 2y þ z ¼ 1
y þ 3z ¼ 2
Thus, v can be written as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 in many ways. For example, let the free
variable z ¼ 1, and, by back-substitution, we get y ¼ 2 and x ¼ 2. Thus, v ¼ 2u1  2u2 þ u3 .

3.25. Let u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 4Þ, u2 ¼ ð2; 3; 1Þ, u3 ¼ ð2; 1; 1Þ in R3 . Show that u1 ; u2 ; u3 are orthogonal, and
write v as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 , where (a) v ¼ ð7; 16; 6Þ, (b) v ¼ ð3; 5; 2Þ.
Take the dot product of pairs of vectors to get
u1  u2 ¼ 2  6 þ 4 ¼ 0; u1  u3 ¼ 2 þ 2  4 ¼ 0; u2  u3 ¼ 4  3  1 ¼ 0
Thus, the three vectors in R3 are orthogonal, and hence Fourier coefﬁcients can be used. That is,
v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 , where

3.26. Find the dimension and a basis for the general solution W of each of the following homogeneous
systems:
2x1 þ 4x2  5x3 þ 3x4 ¼ 0
x  2y  3z ¼ 0
3x1 þ 6x2  7x3 þ 4x4 ¼ 0
2x þ y þ 3z ¼ 0
5x1 þ 10x2  11x3 þ 6x4 ¼ 0
3x  4y  2z ¼ 0
(a)
(b)
(a) Reduce the system to echelon form using the operations ‘‘Replace L2 by 3L1 þ 2L2 ,’’ ‘‘Replace L3 by
5L1 þ 2L3 ,’’ and then ‘‘Replace L3 by 2L2 þ L3 .’’ These operations yield

2x1 þ 4x2  5x3 þ 3x4 ¼ 0
2x1 þ 4x2  5x3 þ 3x4 ¼ 0
x3  x4 ¼ 0
and
x3  x4 ¼ 0
3x3  3x4 ¼ 0
The system in echelon form has two free variables, x2 and x4 , so dim W ¼ 2. A basis ½u1 ; u2  for W may
be obtained as follows:
(1) Set x2 ¼ 1, x4 ¼ 0. Back-substitution yields x3 ¼ 0, and then x1 ¼ 2. Thus, u1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0Þ.
(2) Set x2 ¼ 0, x4 ¼ 1. Back-substitution yields x3 ¼ 1, and then x1 ¼ 1. Thus, u2 ¼ ð1; 0; 1; 1Þ.
(b) Reduce the system to echelon form, obtaining
x  2y  3z ¼ 0
x  2y  3z ¼ 0
5y þ 9z ¼ 0
and
5y þ 9z ¼ 0
2y þ 7z ¼ 0
17z ¼ 0
There are no free variables (the system is in triangular form). Hence, dim W ¼ 0, and W has no basis.
Speciﬁcally, W consists only of the zero solution; that is, W ¼ f0g.

3.27. Find the dimension and a basis for the general solution W of the following homogeneous system
using matrix notation:
x1 þ 2x2 þ 3x3  2x4 þ 4x5 ¼ 0
2x1 þ 4x2 þ 8x3 þ x4 þ 9x5 ¼ 0
3x1 þ 6x2 þ 13x3 þ 4x4 þ 14x5 ¼ 0
Show how the basis gives the parametric form of the general solution of the system.
When a system is homogeneous, we represent the system by its coefﬁcient matrix A rather than by its

augmented matrix M, because the last column of the augmented matrix M is a zero column, and it will
remain a zero column during any row-reduction process.

(The third row of the second matrix is deleted, because it is a multiple of the second row and will result in a
zero row.) We can now proceed in one of two ways.
(a) Write down the corresponding homogeneous system in echelon form:

x1 þ 2x2 þ 3x3  2x4 þ 4x5 ¼ 0
2x3 þ 5x4 þ x5 ¼ 0
The system in echelon form has three free variables, x2 ; x4 ; x5 , so dim W ¼ 3. A basis ½u1 ; u2 ; u3  for W
may be obtained as follows:
(1) Set x2 ¼ 1, x4 ¼ 0, x5 ¼ 0. Back-substitution yields x3 ¼ 0, and then x1 ¼ 2. Thus,
u1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ.
(2) Set x2 ¼ 0, x4 ¼ 1, x5 ¼ 0. Back-substitution yields x3 ¼  52, and then x1 ¼ 19
2 . Thus,

u2 ¼ ð19

(3) Set x2 ¼ 0, x4 ¼ 0, x5 ¼ 1. Back-substitution yields x3 ¼  12, and then x1 ¼  52. Thus,
u3 ¼ ð 52, 0,  12 ; 0; 1Þ.
[One could avoid fractions in the basis by choosing x4 ¼ 2 in (2) and x5 ¼ 2 in (3), which yields
multiples of u2 and u3 .] The parametric form of the general solution is obtained from the following
linear combination of the basis vectors using parameters a; b; c:

Using these equations for the pivot variables x1 and x3 , repeat the above process to obtain a basis ½u1 ; u2 ; u3 
for W . That is, set x2 ¼ 1, x4 ¼ 0, x5 ¼ 0 to get u1 ; set x2 ¼ 0, x4 ¼ 1, x5 ¼ 0 to get u2 ; and set x2 ¼ 0,
x4 ¼ 0, x5 ¼ 1 to get u3 .

3.28. Prove Theorem 3.15. Let v 0 be a particular solution of AX ¼ B, and let W be the general solution
of AX ¼ 0. Then U ¼ v 0 þ W ¼ fv 0 þ w : w 2 W g is the general solution of AX ¼ B.
Let w be a solution of AX ¼ 0. Then

Aðv 0 þ wÞ ¼ Av 0 þ Aw ¼ B þ 0 ¼ B
Thus, the sum v 0 þ w is a solution of AX ¼ B. On the other hand, suppose v is also a solution of AX ¼ B.
Then
Aðv  v 0 Þ ¼ Av  Av 0 ¼ B  B ¼ 0
Therefore, v  v 0 belongs to W . Because v ¼ v 0 þ ðv  v 0 Þ, we ﬁnd that any solution of AX ¼ B can be
obtained by adding a solution of AX ¼ 0 to a solution of AX ¼ B. Thus, the theorem is proved.

Step 2. Write down the inverse row operations.
Step 3. Write M as the product of the elementary matrices corresponding to the inverse operations. This
gives the desired result.
If a zero row appears in Step 1, then M is not row equivalent to the identity matrix I, and M cannot be

3.33. Show that every elementary matrix E is invertible, and its inverse is an elementary matrix.
Let E be the elementary matrix corresponding to the elementary operation e; that is, eðIÞ ¼ E. Let e0 be
the inverse operation of e and let E0 be the corresponding elementary matrix; that is, e0 ðIÞ ¼ E0 . Then

I ¼ e0 ðeðIÞÞ ¼ e0 ðEÞ ¼ E0 E
Therefore, E0 is the inverse of E.

and

I ¼ eðe0 ðIÞÞ ¼ eðE0 Þ ¼ EE0

3.34. Prove Theorem 3.16: Let e be an elementary row operation and let E be the corresponding
m-square elementary matrix; that is, E ¼ eðIÞ. Then eðAÞ ¼ EA, where A is any m n matrix.
Let Ri be the row i of A; we denote this by writing A ¼ ½R1 ; . . . ; Rm . If B is a matrix for which AB is
deﬁned then AB ¼ ½R1 B; . . . ; Rm B. We also let
ei ¼ ð0; . . . ; 0; ^

Here ^¼ i means 1 is the ith entry. One can show (Problem 2.45) that ei A ¼ Ri . We also note that

3.35. Prove Theorem 3.17: Let A be a square matrix. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) A is invertible (nonsingular).

(b) A is row equivalent to the identity matrix I.
(c) A is a product of elementary matrices.
Suppose A is invertible and suppose A is row equivalent to matrix B in row canonical form. Then there
exist elementary matrices E1 ; E2 ; . . . ; Es such that Es . . . E2 E1 A ¼ B. Because A is invertible and each
elementary matrix is invertible, B is also invertible. But if B 6¼ I, then B has a zero row; whence B is not
invertible. Thus, B ¼ I, and (a) implies (b).

104

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

If (b) holds, then there exist elementary matrices E1 ; E2 ; . . . ; Es such that Es . . . E2 E1 A ¼ I. Hence,
A ¼ ðEs . . . E2 E1 Þ1 ¼ E11 E21 . . . ; Es1 . But the Ei1 are also elementary matrices. Thus (b) implies (c).
If (c) holds, then A ¼ E1 E2 . . . Es . The Ei are invertible matrices; hence, their product A is also
invertible. Thus, (c) implies (a). Accordingly, the theorem is proved.

3.36. Prove Theorem 3.18: If AB ¼ I, then BA ¼ I, and hence B ¼ A1 .
Suppose A is not invertible. Then A is not row equivalent to the identity matrix I, and so A is row
equivalent to a matrix with a zero row. In other words, there exist elementary matrices E1 ; . . . ; Es such
that Es . . . E2 E1 A has a zero row. Hence, Es . . . E2 E1 AB ¼ Es . . . E2 E1 , an invertible matrix, also has a
zero row. But invertible matrices cannot have zero rows; hence A is invertible, with inverse A1 . Then
also,
B ¼ IB ¼ ðA1 AÞB ¼ A1 ðABÞ ¼ A1 I ¼ A1

3.37. Prove Theorem 3.19: B is row equivalent to A (written B
nonsingular matrix P such that B ¼ PA.

If B A, then B ¼ es ð. . . ðe2 ðe1 ðAÞÞÞ . . .Þ ¼ Es . . . E2 E1 A ¼ PA where P ¼ Es . . . E2 E1 is nonsingular.
Conversely, suppose B ¼ PA, where P is nonsingular. By Theorem 3.17, P is a product of elementary
matrices, and so B can be obtained from A by a sequence of elementary row operations; that is, B A. Thus,
the theorem is proved.

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations

Miscellaneous Problems
3.43. Let L be a linear combination of the m equations in n unknowns in the system (3.2). Say L is the
equation
ðc1 a11 þ    þ cm am1 Þx1 þ    þ ðc1 a1n þ    þ cm amn Þxn ¼ c1 b1 þ    þ cm bm

ð1Þ

Show that any solution of the system (3.2) is also a solution of L.
Let u ¼ ðk1 ; . . . ; kn Þ be a solution of (3.2). Then
ai1 k1 þ ai2 k2 þ    þ ain kn ¼ bi

ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; mÞ

ð2Þ

Substituting u in the left-hand side of (1) and using (2), we get
ðc1 a11 þ    þ cm am1 Þk1 þ    þ ðc1 a1n þ    þ cm amn Þkn
¼ c1 ða11 k1 þ    þ a1n kn Þ þ    þ cm ðam1 k1 þ    þ amn kn Þ
¼ c1 b1 þ    þ cm bm
This is the right-hand side of (1); hence, u is a solution of (1).

3.44. Suppose a system m of linear equations is obtained from a system l by applying an elementary
operation (page 64). Show that m and l have the same solutions.
Each equation L in m is a linear combination of equations in l. Hence, by Problem 3.43, any solution
of l will also be a solution of m. On the other hand, each elementary operation has an inverse elementary
operation, so l can be obtained from m by an elementary operation. This means that any solution of m is a
solution of l. Thus, l and m have the same solutions.

3.45. Prove Theorem 3.4: Suppose a system m of linear equations is obtained from a system l by a
sequence of elementary operations. Then m and l have the same solutions.
Each step of the sequence does not change the solution set (Problem 3.44). Thus, the original system l
and the ﬁnal system m (and any system in between) have the same solutions.

3.46. A system l of linear equations is said to be consistent if no linear combination of its equations is
a degenerate equation L with a nonzero constant. Show that l is consistent if and only if l is
reducible to echelon form.
Suppose l is reducible to echelon form. Then l has a solution, which must also be a solution of every
linear combination of its equations. Thus, L, which has no solution, cannot be a linear combination of the
equations in l. Thus, l is consistent.
On the other hand, suppose l is not reducible to echelon form. Then, in the reduction process, it must
yield a degenerate equation L with a nonzero constant, which is a linear combination of the equations in l.
Therefore, l is not consistent; that is, l is inconsistent.

3.47. Suppose u and v are distinct vectors. Show that, for distinct scalars k, the vectors u þ kðu  vÞ are
distinct.
Suppose u þ k1 ðu  vÞ ¼ u þ k2 ðu  vÞ: We need only show that k1 ¼ k2 . We have
k1 ðu  vÞ ¼ k2 ðu  vÞ;

and so

ðk1  k2 Þðu  vÞ ¼ 0

Because u and v are distinct, u  v 6¼ 0. Hence, k1  k2 ¼ 0, and so k1 ¼ k2 .

3.48. Suppose AB is deﬁned. Prove
(a) Suppose A has a zero row. Then AB has a zero row.

(b) Suppose B has a zero column. Then AB has a zero column.

107

CHAPTER 3 Systems of Linear Equations
(a) Let Ri be the zero row of A, and C1 ; . . . ; Cn the columns of B. Then the ith row of AB is

ðRi C1 ; Ri C2 ; . . . ; Ri Cn Þ ¼ ð0; 0; 0; . . . ; 0Þ
(b) BT has a zero row, and so BT AT ¼ ðABÞT has a zero row. Hence, AB has a zero column.

Vector Spaces
4.1

Introduction

This chapter introduces the underlying structure of linear algebra, that of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
space. The deﬁnition of a vector space V, whose elements are called vectors, involves an arbitrary ﬁeld K,
whose elements are called scalars. The following notation will be used (unless otherwise stated or
implied):
V
u; v; w

the given vector space
vectors in V

K

the given number field

a; b; c; or k

scalars in K

Almost nothing essential is lost if the reader assumes that K is the real ﬁeld R or the complex ﬁeld C.
The reader might suspect that the real line R has ‘‘dimension’’ one, the cartesian plane R2 has
‘‘dimension’’ two, and the space R3 has ‘‘dimension’’ three. This chapter formalizes the notion of
‘‘dimension,’’ and this deﬁnition will agree with the reader’s intuition.
Throughout this text, we will use the following set notation:
a2A

Element a belongs to set A

a; b 2 A
8x 2 A

Elements a and b belong to A
For every x in A

9x 2 A

There exists an x in A

AB

A is a subset of B

A\B
A[B

Intersection of A and B
Union of A and B

;

Vector Spaces

The following deﬁnes the notion of a vector space V where K is the ﬁeld of scalars.
DEFINITION:

Let V be a nonempty set with two operations:
(i) Vector Addition: This assigns to any u; v 2 V a sum u þ v in V.
(ii) Scalar Multiplication: This assigns to any u 2 V, k 2 K a product ku 2 V.
Then V is called a vector space (over the ﬁeld K) if the following axioms hold for any
vectors u; v; w 2 V :

ðu þ vÞ þ w ¼ u þ ðv þ wÞ
There is a vector in V, denoted by 0 and called the zero vector, such that, for any
u 2 V;
uþ0¼0þu¼u
For each u 2 V ; there is a vector in V, denoted by u, and called the negative of u,
such that
u þ ðuÞ ¼ ðuÞ þ u ¼ 0.
u þ v ¼ v þ u.
kðu þ vÞ ¼ ku þ kv, for any scalar k 2 K:
ða þ bÞu ¼ au þ bu; for any scalars a; b 2 K.
ðabÞu ¼ aðbuÞ; for any scalars a; b 2 K.
1u ¼ u, for the unit scalar 1 2 K.

The above axioms naturally split into two sets (as indicated by the labeling of the axioms). The ﬁrst
four are concerned only with the additive structure of V and can be summarized by saying V is a
commutative group under addition. This means
Any sum v 1 þ v 2 þ    þ v m of vectors requires no parentheses and does not depend on the order of
the summands.
(b) The zero vector 0 is unique, and the negative u of a vector u is unique.
(c) (Cancellation Law) If u þ w ¼ v þ w, then u ¼ v.
(a)

Also, subtraction in V is deﬁned by u  v ¼ u þ ðvÞ, where v is the unique negative of v.
On the other hand, the remaining four axioms are concerned with the ‘‘action’’ of the ﬁeld K of scalars
on the vector space V. Using these additional axioms, we prove (Problem 4.2) the following simple
properties of a vector space.
THEOREM 4.1:

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K.
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

4.3

For any scalar k 2 K and 0 2 V ; k0 ¼ 0.
For 0 2 K and any vector u 2 V ; 0u ¼ 0.
If ku ¼ 0, where k 2 K and u 2 V, then k ¼ 0 or u ¼ 0.
For any k 2 K and any u 2 V ; ðkÞu ¼ kðuÞ ¼ ku.

Examples of Vector Spaces

This section lists important examples of vector spaces that will be used throughout the text.

Space K n
Let K be an arbitrary ﬁeld. The notation K n is frequently used to denote the set of all n-tuples of elements
in K. Here K n is a vector space over K using the following operations:
(i) Vector Addition: ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ þ ðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ ¼ ða1 þ b1 ; a2 þ b2 ; . . . ; an þ bn Þ
(ii) Scalar Multiplication: kða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ ¼ ðka1 ; ka2 ; . . . ; kan Þ
The zero vector in K n is the n-tuple of zeros,
0 ¼ ð0; 0; . . . ; 0Þ
and the negative of a vector is deﬁned by
ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ
Observe that these are the same as the operations deﬁned for Rn in Chapter 1. The proof that K n is a
vector space is identical to the proof of Theorem 1.1, which we now regard as stating that Rn with the
operations deﬁned there is a vector space over R.

114

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Polynomial Space PðtÞ
Let PðtÞ denote the set of all polynomials of the form
pðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1 t þ a2 t2 þ    þ as ts

ðs ¼ 1; 2; . . .Þ

where the coefﬁcients ai belong to a ﬁeld K. Then PðtÞ is a vector space over K using the following operations:
(i) Vector Addition: Here pðtÞ þ qðtÞ in PðtÞ is the usual operation of addition of polynomials.
(ii) Scalar Multiplication: Here kpðtÞ in PðtÞ is the usual operation of the product of a scalar k and a
polynomial pðtÞ.
The zero polynomial 0 is the zero vector in PðtÞ.

Polynomial Space Pn ðtÞ
Let Pn ðtÞ denote the set of all polynomials pðtÞ over a ﬁeld K, where the degree of pðtÞ is less than or
equal to n; that is,
pðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1 t þ a2 t2 þ    þ as ts
where s  n. Then Pn ðtÞ is a vector space over K with respect to the usual operations of addition of
polynomials and of multiplication of a polynomial by a constant (just like the vector space PðtÞ above).
We include the zero polynomial 0 as an element of Pn ðtÞ, even though its degree is undeﬁned.

Matrix Space Mm;n
The notation Mm;n , or simply M; will be used to denote the set of all m n matrices with entries in a ﬁeld
K. Then Mm;n is a vector space over K with respect to the usual operations of matrix addition and scalar
multiplication of matrices, as indicated by Theorem 2.1.

Function Space FðXÞ
Let X be a nonempty set and let K be an arbitrary ﬁeld. Let FðX Þ denote the set of all functions of X into
K. [Note that FðX Þ is nonempty, because X is nonempty.] Then FðX Þ is a vector space over K with
respect to the following operations:
(i) Vector Addition: The sum of two functions f and g in FðX Þ is the function f þ g in FðX Þ deﬁned by
ð f þ gÞðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ þ gðxÞ

8x 2 X

(ii) Scalar Multiplication: The product of a scalar k 2 K and a function f in FðX Þ is the function kf in
FðX Þ deﬁned by
ðkf ÞðxÞ ¼ kf ðxÞ

8x 2 X

The zero vector in FðX Þ is the zero function 0, which maps every x 2 X into the zero element 0 2 K;
0ðxÞ ¼ 0

8x 2 X

Also, for any function f in FðX Þ, negative of f is the function f in FðX Þ deﬁned by
ðf ÞðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ

8x 2 X

Fields and Subﬁelds
Suppose a ﬁeld E is an extension of a ﬁeld K; that is, suppose E is a ﬁeld that contains K as a subﬁeld.
Then E may be viewed as a vector space over K using the following operations:
(i) Vector Addition: Here u þ v in E is the usual addition in E.
(ii) Scalar Multiplication: Here ku in E, where k 2 K and u 2 E, is the usual product of k and u as
elements of E.
That is, the eight axioms of a vector space are satisﬁed by E and its subﬁeld K with respect to the above
two operations.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Linear Combinations, Spanning Sets

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K. A vector v in V is a linear combination of vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um in
V if there exist scalars a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; am in K such that
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ am um
Alternatively, v is a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um if there is a solution to the vector equation
v ¼ x1 u1 þ x2 u2 þ    þ xm um
where x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xm are unknown scalars.
EXAMPLE 4.1 (Linear Combinations in Rn ) Suppose we want to express v ¼ ð3; 7; 4Þ in R3 as a linear
combination of the vectors

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

u2 ¼ ð2; 3; 7Þ;

u3 ¼ ð3; 5; 6Þ

We seek scalars x, y, z such that v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 ; that is,

2 3
3
2 3
2 3

3
1
2
4 3 5 ¼ x4 2 5 þ y4 3 5 þ z4 5 5

3
7
2

or

x þ 2y þ 3z ¼ 3
2x þ 3y þ 5z ¼ 7
3x þ 7y þ 6z ¼ 4

(For notational convenience, we have written the vectors in R3 as columns, because it is then easier to ﬁnd the
equivalent system of linear equations.) Reducing the system to echelon form yields

x þ 2y þ 3z ¼
3
y  z ¼
1
y  3z ¼ 13

and then

Back-substitution yields the solution

x þ 2y þ 3z ¼
3
y  z ¼
1
 4z ¼ 12

x ¼ 2, y ¼ 4, z ¼ 3. Thus, v ¼ 2u1  4u2 þ 3u3 .

Remark: Generally speaking, the question of expressing a given vector v in K n as a linear
combination of vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um in K n is equivalent to solving a system AX ¼ B of linear equations,
where v is the column B of constants, and the u’s are the columns of the coefﬁcient matrix A. Such a
system may have a unique solution (as above), many solutions, or no solution. The last case—no
solution—means that v cannot be written as a linear combination of the u’s.
EXAMPLE 4.2 (Linear combinations in PðtÞ) Suppose we want to express the polynomial v ¼ 3t2 þ 5t  5 as a
linear combination of the polynomials

p1 ¼ t2 þ 2t þ 1;

p2 ¼ 2t2 þ 5t þ 4;

p3 ¼ t2 þ 3t þ 6

We seek scalars x, y, z such that v ¼ xp1 þ yp2 þ zp3 ; that is,

3t2 þ 5t  5 ¼ xðt2 þ 2t þ 1Þ þ yð2t2 þ 5t þ 4Þ þ zðt2 þ 3t þ 6Þ
There are two ways to proceed from here.
(1)

Expand the right-hand side of (*) obtaining:

3t 2 þ 5t  5 ¼ xt 2 þ 2xt þ x þ 2yt 2 þ 5yt þ 4y þ zt 2 þ 3zt þ 6z
¼ ðx þ 2y þ zÞt 2 þ ð2x þ 5y þ 3zÞt þ ðx þ 4y þ 6zÞ
Set coefﬁcients of the same powers of t equal to each other, and reduce the system to echelon form:

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 3
2x þ 5y þ 3z ¼ 5
x þ 4y þ 6z ¼ 5

or

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 3
y þ z ¼ 1
2y þ 5z ¼ 8

or

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 3
y þ z ¼ 1
3z ¼ 6

ð*Þ

116

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

The system is in triangular form and has a solution. Back-substitution yields the solution x ¼ 3, y ¼ 1, z ¼ 2.
Thus,

v ¼ 3p1 þ p2  2p3
(2)

The equation (*) is actually an identity in the variable t; that is, the equation holds for any value
of t. We can obtain three equations in the unknowns x, y, z by setting t equal to any three values.
For example,

Set t ¼ 0 in ð1Þ to obtain:

x þ 4y þ 6z ¼ 5

Set t ¼ 1 in ð1Þ to obtain:

4x þ 11y þ 10z ¼ 3

Set t ¼ 1 in ð1Þ to obtain:

y þ 4z ¼ 7

Reducing this system to echelon form and solving by back-substitution again yields the solution x ¼ 3, y ¼ 1,
z ¼ 2. Thus (again), v ¼ 3p1 þ p2  2p3 .

Spanning Sets
Let V be a vector space over K. Vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um in V are said to span V or to form a spanning set of
V if every v in V is a linear combination of the vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um —that is, if there exist scalars
a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; am in K such that
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ am um
The following remarks follow directly from the deﬁnition.
Remark 1: Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um span V. Then, for any vector w, the set w; u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um also
spans V.
Remark 2: Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um span V and suppose uk is a linear combination of some of the
other u’s. Then the u’s without uk also span V.
Remark 3: Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um span V and suppose one of the u’s is the zero vector. Then the
u’s without the zero vector also span V.
EXAMPLE 4.3 Consider the vector space V ¼ R3 .
(a) We claim that the following vectors form a spanning set of R3 :

e1 ¼ ð1; 0; 0Þ;

e2 ¼ ð0; 1; 0Þ;

e3 ¼ ð0; 0; 1Þ

Speciﬁcally, if v ¼ ða; b; cÞ is any vector in R3 , then

v ¼ ae1 þ be2 þ ce3
For example, v ¼ ð5; 6; 2Þ ¼ 5e1  6e2 þ 2e3 .
(b) We claim that the following vectors also form a spanning set of R3 :

w1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ;

w2 ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ;

w3 ¼ ð1; 0; 0Þ

Speciﬁcally, if v ¼ ða; b; cÞ is any vector in R3 , then (Problem 4.62)

v ¼ ða; b; cÞ ¼ cw1 þ ðb  cÞw2 þ ða  bÞw3
For example, v ¼ ð5; 6; 2Þ ¼ 2w1  8w2 þ 11w3 .
(c) One can show (Problem 3.24) that v ¼ ð2; 7; 8Þ cannot be written as a linear combination of the vectors

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

u2 ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ;

Accordingly, u1 , u2 , u3 do not span R3 .

u3 ¼ ð1; 5; 9Þ

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

(a) Clearly every polynomial in Pn ðtÞ can be expressed as a linear combination of the n þ 1 polynomials

t;

t3 ;

Thus, these powers of t (where 1 ¼ t0 ) form a spanning set for Pn ðtÞ.

ðt  cÞ2 ;

t  c;

ðt  cÞ3 ;

ðt  cÞn

(where ðt  cÞ0 ¼ 1), also form a spanning set for Pn ðtÞ.

Accordingly, the four matrices E11 , E12 , E21 , E22 span M.

4.5

Subspaces

This section introduces the important notion of a subspace.
Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K and let W be a subset of V. Then W is a subspace
of V if W is itself a vector space over K with respect to the operations of vector
addition and scalar multiplication on V.
The way in which one shows that any set W is a vector space is to show that W satisﬁes the eight
axioms of a vector space. However, if W is a subset of a vector space V, then some of the axioms
automatically hold in W, because they already hold in V. Simple criteria for identifying subspaces follow.
DEFINITION:

THEOREM 4.2:

Suppose W is a subset of a vector space V. Then W is a subspace of V if the following
two conditions hold:
(a) The zero vector 0 belongs to W.
(b) For every u; v 2 W; k 2 K: (i) The sum u þ v 2 W. (ii) The multiple ku 2 W.

Property (i) in (b) states that W is closed under vector addition, and property (ii) in (b) states that W is
closed under scalar multiplication. Both properties may be combined into the following equivalent single
statement:
(b0 ) For every u; v 2 W ; a; b 2 K, the linear combination au þ bv 2 W.
Now let V be any vector space. Then V automatically contains two subspaces: the set {0} consisting of
the zero vector alone and the whole space V itself. These are sometimes called the trivial subspaces of V.
Examples of nontrivial subspaces follow.
EXAMPLE 4.6 Consider the vector space V ¼ R3 .
(a) Let U consist of all vectors in R3 whose entries are equal; that is,

U ¼ fða; b; cÞ : a ¼ b ¼ cg
For example, (1, 1, 1), (73, 73, 73), (7, 7, 7), (72, 72, 72) are vectors in U . Geometrically, U is the line
through the origin O and the point (1, 1, 1) as shown in Fig. 4-1(a). Clearly 0 ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ belongs to U , because

118

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

all entries in 0 are equal. Further, suppose u and v are arbitrary vectors in U , say, u ¼ ða; a; aÞ and v ¼ ðb; b; bÞ.
Then, for any scalar k 2 R, the following are also vectors in U :

u þ v ¼ ða þ b; a þ b; a þ bÞ

and

ku ¼ ðka; ka; kaÞ

Thus, U is a subspace of R3 .
(b) Let W be any plane in R3 passing through the origin, as pictured in Fig. 4-1(b). Then 0 ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ belongs to W,
because we assumed W passes through, the origin O. Further, suppose u and v are vectors in W. Then u and v
may be viewed as arrows in the plane W emanating from the origin O, as in Fig. 4-1(b). The sum u þ v and any
multiple ku of u also lie in the plane W. Thus, W is a subspace of R3 .

Figure 4-1

EXAMPLE 4.7
(a) Let V ¼ Mn;n , the vector space of n n matrices. Let W1 be the subset of all (upper) triangular matrices and let
W2 be the subset of all symmetric matrices. Then W1 is a subspace of V, because W1 contains the zero matrix 0
and W1 is closed under matrix addition and scalar multiplication; that is, the sum and scalar multiple of such
triangular matrices are also triangular. Similarly, W2 is a subspace of V.
(b) Let V ¼ PðtÞ, the vector space PðtÞ of polynomials. Then the space Pn ðtÞ of polynomials of degree at most n
may be viewed as a subspace of PðtÞ. Let QðtÞ be the collection of polynomials with only even powers of t. For
example, the following are polynomials in QðtÞ:

p1 ¼ 3 þ 4t 2  5t6

and

p2 ¼ 6  7t 4 þ 9t 6 þ 3t 12

(We assume that any constant k ¼ kt0 is an even power of t.) Then QðtÞ is a subspace of PðtÞ.
(c) Let V be the vector space of real-valued functions. Then the collection W1 of continuous functions and the
collection W2 of differentiable functions are subspaces of V.

Intersection of Subspaces
Let U and W be subspaces of a vector space V. We show that the intersection U \ W is also a subspace of
V. Clearly, 0 2 U and 0 2 W, because U and W are subspaces; whence 0 2 U \ W. Now suppose u and v
belong to the intersection U \ W. Then u; v 2 U and u; v 2 W. Further, because U and W are subspaces,
for any scalars a; b 2 K,
au þ bv 2 U

and

au þ bv 2 W

Thus, au þ bv 2 U \ W. Therefore, U \ W is a subspace of V.
The above result generalizes as follows.
THEOREM 4.3:

The intersection of any number of subspaces of a vector space V is a subspace of V.

119

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Solution Space of a Homogeneous System
Consider a system AX ¼ B of linear equations in n unknowns. Then every solution u may be viewed as a
vector in K n . Thus, the solution set of such a system is a subset of K n . Now suppose the system is
homogeneous; that is, suppose the system has the form AX ¼ 0. Let W be its solution set. Because
A0 ¼ 0, the zero vector 0 2 W. Moreover, suppose u and v belong to W. Then u and v are solutions of
AX ¼ 0, or, in other words, Au ¼ 0 and Av ¼ 0. Therefore, for any scalars a and b, we have
Aðau þ bvÞ ¼ aAu þ bAv ¼ a0 þ b0 ¼ 0 þ 0 ¼ 0
Thus, au þ bv belongs to W, because it is a solution of AX ¼ 0. Accordingly, W is a subspace of K n .
We state the above result formally.
THEOREM 4.4:

The solution set W of a homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 in n unknowns is a subspace
of K n .

We emphasize that the solution set of a nonhomogeneous system AX ¼ B is not a subspace of K n . In
fact, the zero vector 0 does not belong to its solution set.

4.6

Linear Spans, Row Space of a Matrix

Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um are any vectors in a vector space V. Recall (Section 4.4) that any vector of the
form a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ am um , where the ai are scalars, is called a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um .
The collection of all such linear combinations, denoted by
spanðu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um Þ

or

spanðui Þ

is called the linear span of u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; um .
Clearly the zero vector 0 belongs to spanðui Þ, because
0 ¼ 0u1 þ 0u2 þ    þ 0um
Furthermore, suppose v and v 0 belong to spanðui Þ, say,
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ am um
and
v 0 ¼ b1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ    þ bm um
Then,
v þ v 0 ¼ ða1 þ b1 Þu1 þ ða2 þ b2 Þu2 þ    þ ðam þ bm Þum
and, for any scalar k 2 K,
kv ¼ ka1 u1 þ ka2 u2 þ    þ kam um
Thus, v þ v 0 and kv also belong to spanðui Þ. Accordingly, spanðui Þ is a subspace of V.
More generally, for any subset S of V, spanðSÞ consists of all linear combinations of vectors in S or,
when S ¼ f, span(S) ¼ f0g. Thus, in particular, S is a spanning set (Section 4.4) of spanðSÞ.
The following theorem, which was partially proved above, holds.
THEOREM 4.5:

Let S be a subset of a vector space V.
(i) Then spanðSÞ is a subspace of V that contains S.
(ii) If W is a subspace of V containing S, then spanðSÞ  W.

Condition (ii) in theorem 4.5 may be interpreted as saying that spanðSÞ is the ‘‘smallest’’ subspace of
V containing S.
EXAMPLE 4.8 Consider the vector space V ¼ R3 .
(a) Let u be any nonzero vector in R3 . Then spanðuÞ consists of all scalar multiples of u. Geometrically, spanðuÞ is
the line through the origin O and the endpoint of u, as shown in Fig. 4-2(a).

(b) Let u and v be vectors in R3 that are not multiples of each other. Then spanðu; vÞ is the plane through the origin
O and the endpoints of u and v as shown in Fig. 4-2(b).
(c) Consider the vectors e1 ¼ ð1; 0; 0Þ, e2 ¼ ð0; 1; 0Þ, e3 ¼ ð0; 0; 1Þ in R3 . Recall [Example 4.1(a)] that every vector
in R3 is a linear combination of e1 , e2 , e3 . That is, e1 , e2 , e3 form a spanning set of R3 . Accordingly,
spanðe1 ; e2 ; e3 Þ ¼ R3 .

Row Space of a Matrix
Let A ¼ ½aij  be an arbitrary m
R1 ¼ ða11 ; a12 ; . . . ; a1n Þ;

n matrix over a ﬁeld K. The rows of A,
R2 ¼ ða21 ; a22 ; . . . ; a2n Þ;

...;

Rm ¼ ðam1 ; am2 ; . . . ; amn Þ

may be viewed as vectors in K n ; hence, they span a subspace of K n called the row space of A and denoted
by rowsp(A). That is,
rowspðAÞ ¼ spanðR1 ; R2 ; . . . ; Rm Þ
Analagously, the columns of A may be viewed as vectors in K m called the column space of A and denoted
by colsp(A). Observe that colspðAÞ ¼ rowspðAT Þ.
Recall that matrices A and B are row equivalent, written A B, if B can be obtained from A by a
sequence of elementary row operations. Now suppose M is the matrix obtained by applying one of the
following elementary row operations on a matrix A:
ð1Þ

Interchange Ri and Rj ;

ð2Þ

Replace Ri by kRi ;

ð3Þ Replace Rj by kRi þ Rj

Then each row of M is a row of A or a linear combination of rows of A. Hence, the row space of M is
contained in the row space of A. On the other hand, we can apply the inverse elementary row operation on
M to obtain A; hence, the row space of A is contained in the row space of M. Accordingly, A and M have
the same row space. This will be true each time we apply an elementary row operation. Thus, we have
proved the following theorem.
THEOREM 4.6:

Row equivalent matrices have the same row space.

We are now able to prove (Problems 4.45–4.47) basic results on row equivalence (which ﬁrst
appeared as Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 in Chapter 3).
THEOREM 4.7:

Suppose A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  are row equivalent echelon matrices with respective
pivot entries
a1j1 ; a2j2 ; . . . ; arjr

and

b1k1 ; b2k2 ; . . . ; bsks

Then A and B have the same number of nonzero rows—that is, r ¼ s—and their
pivot entries are in the same positions—that is, j1 ¼ k1 ; j2 ¼ k2 ; . . . ; jr ¼ kr .
THEOREM 4.8:

Suppose A and B are row canonical matrices. Then A and B have the same row space
if and only if they have the same nonzero rows.

121

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
COROLLARY 4.9:

Every matrix A is row equivalent to a unique matrix in row canonical form.

We apply the above results in the next example.
EXAMPLE 4.9 Consider the following two sets of vectors in R4 :

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 1; 3Þ;
u2 ¼ ð2; 4; 1; 2Þ;
u3 ¼ ð3; 6; 3; 7Þ
w2 ¼ ð2; 4; 5; 14Þ
w1 ¼ ð1; 2; 4; 11Þ;
Let U ¼ spanðui Þ and W ¼ spanðwi Þ. There are two ways to show that U ¼ W.
(a) Show that each ui is a linear combination of w1 and w2 , and show that each wi is a linear combination of u1 , u2 ,
u3 . Observe that we have to show that six systems of linear equations are consistent.
(b) Form the matrix A whose rows are u1 , u2 , u3 and row reduce A to row canonical form, and form the matrix B
whose rows are w1 and w2 and row reduce B to row canonical form:

Because the nonzero rows of the matrices in row canonical form are identical, the row spaces of A and B are
equal. Therefore, U ¼ W.
Clearly, the method in (b) is more efﬁcient than the method in (a).

4.7

Linear Dependence and Independence

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K. The following deﬁnes the notion of linear dependence and
independence of vectors over K. (One usually suppresses mentioning K when the ﬁeld is understood.)
This concept plays an essential role in the theory of linear algebra and in mathematics in general.
DEFINITION:

We say that the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m in V are linearly dependent if there exist scalars
a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; am in K, not all of them 0, such that
a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ am v m ¼ 0
Otherwise, we say that the vectors are linearly independent.

The above deﬁnition may be restated as follows. Consider the vector equation
x1 v 1 þ x2 v 2 þ    þ xm v m ¼ 0

ð*Þ

where the x’s are unknown scalars. This equation always has the zero solution x1 ¼ 0;
x2 ¼ 0; . . . ; xm ¼ 0. Suppose this is the only solution; that is, suppose we can show:
x1 v 1 þ x2 v 2 þ    þ xm v m ¼ 0

implies

x1 ¼ 0;

x2 ¼ 0;

...;

xm ¼ 0

Then the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m are linearly independent, On the other hand, suppose the equation (*) has
a nonzero solution; then the vectors are linearly dependent.
A set S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m g of vectors in V is linearly dependent or independent according to whether
the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m are linearly dependent or independent.
An inﬁnite set S of vectors is linearly dependent or independent according to whether there do or do
not exist vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v k in S that are linearly dependent.
Warning: The set S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m g above represents a list or, in other words, a ﬁnite sequence
of vectors where the vectors are ordered and repetition is permitted.

122

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

The following remarks follow directly from the above deﬁnition.
Remark 1: Suppose 0 is one of the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m , say v 1 ¼ 0. Then the vectors must be
linearly dependent, because we have the following linear combination where the coefﬁcient of v 1 6¼ 0:
1v 1 þ 0v 2 þ    þ 0v m ¼ 1  0 þ 0 þ    þ 0 ¼ 0
Remark 2:

Suppose v is a nonzero vector. Then v, by itself, is linearly independent, because
kv ¼ 0;

v 6¼ 0

implies

k¼0

Remark 3: Suppose two of the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m are equal or one is a scalar multiple of the
other, say v 1 ¼ kv 2 . Then the vectors must be linearly dependent, because we have the following linear
combination where the coefﬁcient of v 1 6¼ 0:
v 1  kv2 þ 0v 3 þ    þ 0v m ¼ 0
Remark 4:
the other.

Two vectors v 1 and v 2 are linearly dependent if and only if one of them is a multiple of

Remark 5: If the set fv 1 ; . . . ; v m g is linearly independent, then any rearrangement of the vectors
fv i1 ; v i2 ; . . . ; v im g is also linearly independent.
Remark 6: If a set S of vectors is linearly independent, then any subset of S is linearly
independent. Alternatively, if S contains a linearly dependent subset, then S is linearly dependent.
EXAMPLE 4.10
(a) Let u ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ, v ¼ ð1; 3; 2Þ, w ¼ ð4; 9; 5Þ. Then u, v, w are linearly dependent, because

3u þ 5v  2w ¼ 3ð1; 1; 0Þ þ 5ð1; 3; 2Þ  2ð4; 9; 5Þ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ ¼ 0
(b) We show that the vectors u ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, v ¼ ð2; 5; 7Þ, w ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ are linearly independent. We form the vector
equation xu þ yv þ zw ¼ 0, where x, y, z are unknown scalars. This yields

3x þ 7y þ 5z ¼ 0

or

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 0
yþ z¼0
2z ¼ 0

Back-substitution yields x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, z ¼ 0. We have shown that

xu þ yv þ zw ¼ 0

implies

x ¼ 0;

y ¼ 0;

z¼0

Accordingly, u, v, w are linearly independent.
(c) Let V be the vector space of functions from R into R. We show that the functions f ðtÞ ¼ sin t, gðtÞ ¼ et ,
hðtÞ ¼ t2 are linearly independent. We form the vector (function) equation xf þ yg þ zh ¼ 0, where x, y, z are
unknown scalars. This function equation means that, for every value of t,

x sin t þ yet þ zt 2 ¼ 0
Thus, in this equation, we choose appropriate values of t to easily get x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, z ¼ 0. For example,

ðiÞ Substitute t ¼ 0
ðiiÞ Substitute t ¼ p
ðiiiÞ Substitute t ¼ p=2

to obtain xð0Þ þ yð1Þ þ zð0Þ ¼ 0
to obtain xð0Þ þ 0ðep Þ þ zðp2 Þ ¼ 0
to obtain xð1Þ þ 0ðep=2 Þ þ 0ðp2 =4Þ ¼ 0

We have shown

xf þ yg þ zf ¼ 0

implies

x ¼ 0;

Accordingly, u, v, w are linearly independent.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Linear Dependence in R3
Linear dependence in the vector space V ¼ R3 can be described geometrically as follows:
Any two vectors u and v in R3 are linearly dependent if and only if they lie on the same line through
the origin O, as shown in Fig. 4-3(a).
(b) Any three vectors u, v, w in R3 are linearly dependent if and only if they lie on the same plane
through the origin O, as shown in Fig. 4-3(b).
(a)

Later, we will be able to show that any four or more vectors in R3 are automatically linearly dependent.

Figure 4-3

Linear Dependence and Linear Combinations
The notions of linear dependence and linear combinations are closely related. Speciﬁcally, for more than
one vector, we show that the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m are linearly dependent if and only if one of them is a
linear combination of the others.
Suppose, say, v i is a linear combination of the others,
v i ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ ai1 v i1 þ aiþ1 v iþ1 þ    þ am v m
Then by adding v i to both sides, we obtain
a1 v 1 þ    þ ai1 v i1  v i þ aiþ1 v iþ1 þ    þ am v m ¼ 0
where the coefﬁcient of v i is not 0. Hence, the vectors are linearly dependent. Conversely, suppose the
vectors are linearly dependent, say,
b1 v 1 þ    þ bj v j þ    þ bm v m ¼ 0;

where

bj 6¼ 0

Then we can solve for v j obtaining
1

1
v j ¼ b1
j b1 v 1      bj bj1 v j1  bj bjþ1 v jþ1      bj bm v m

and so v j is a linear combination of the other vectors.
We now state a slightly stronger statement than the one above. This result has many important
consequences.
LEMMA 4.10:

Suppose two or more nonzero vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m are linearly dependent. Then one
of the vectors is a linear combination of the preceding vectors; that is, there exists
k > 1 such that
v k ¼ c1 v 1 þ c2 v 2 þ    þ ck1 v k1

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Linear Dependence and Echelon Matrices
Consider the following echelon matrix A, whose pivots have been circled:

2 3 4 5 6 7
60 0 
4 3 2 3 47

0 0 
7 8 97
6
7
40 0 0 0 0 
6 75
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Observe that the rows R2 , R3 , R4 have 0’s in the second column below the nonzero pivot in R1 , and hence
any linear combination of R2 , R3 , R4 must have 0 as its second entry. Thus, R1 cannot be a linear
combination of the rows below it. Similarly, the rows R3 and R4 have 0’s in the third column below the
nonzero pivot in R2 , and hence R2 cannot be a linear combination of the rows below it. Finally, R3 cannot
be a multiple of R4 , because R4 has a 0 in the ﬁfth column below the nonzero pivot in R3 . Viewing the
nonzero rows from the bottom up, R4 , R3 , R2 , R1 , no row is a linear combination of the preceding rows.
Thus, the rows are linearly independent by Lemma 4.10.
The argument used with the above echelon matrix A can be used for the nonzero rows of any echelon
matrix. Thus, we have the following very useful result.
THEOREM 4.11:

4.8

The nonzero rows of a matrix in echelon form are linearly independent.

Basis and Dimension

First we state two equivalent ways to deﬁne a basis of a vector space V. (The equivalence is proved in
Problem 4.28.)
DEFINITION A:

A set S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of vectors is a basis of V if it has the following two
properties: (1) S is linearly independent. (2) S spans V.

DEFINITION B:

A set S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of vectors is a basis of V if every v 2 V can be written
uniquely as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

The following is a fundamental result in linear algebra.
THEOREM 4.12:

Let V be a vector space such that one basis has m elements and another basis has n
elements. Then m ¼ n.

A vector space V is said to be of ﬁnite dimension n or n-dimensional, written
dim V ¼ n
if V has a basis with n elements. Theorem 4.12 tells us that all bases of V have the same number of
elements, so this deﬁnition is well deﬁned.
The vector space {0} is deﬁned to have dimension 0.
Suppose a vector space V does not have a ﬁnite basis. Then V is said to be of inﬁnite dimension or to
be inﬁnite-dimensional.
The above fundamental Theorem 4.12 is a consequence of the following ‘‘replacement lemma’’
(proved in Problem 4.35).
LEMMA 4.13:

Suppose fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g spans V, and suppose fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wm g is linearly independent. Then m  n, and V is spanned by a set of the form
fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wm ; v i1 ; v i2 ; . . . ; v inm g

Thus, in particular, n þ 1 or more vectors in V are linearly dependent.
Observe in the above lemma that we have replaced m of the vectors in the spanning set of V by the m
independent vectors and still retained a spanning set.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Examples of Bases
This subsection presents important examples of bases of some of the main vector spaces appearing in this
text.
(a) Vector space K n : Consider the following n vectors in K n :
e1 ¼ ð1; 0; 0; 0; . . . ; 0; 0Þ; e2 ¼ ð0; 1; 0; 0; . . . ; 0; 0Þ; . . . ; en ¼ ð0; 0; 0; 0; . . . ; 0; 1Þ
These vectors are linearly independent. (For example, they form a matrix in echelon form.)
Furthermore, any vector u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ in K n can be written as a linear combination of the
above vectors. Speciﬁcally,
v ¼ a1 e1 þ a2 e2 þ    þ an en
Accordingly, the vectors form a basis of K n called the usual or standard basis of K n . Thus (as one
might expect), K n has dimension n. In particular, any other basis of K n has n elements.
(b) Vector space M ¼ Mr;s of all r s matrices: The following six matrices form a basis of the
vector space M2;3 of all 2 3 matrices over K:


More generally, in the vector space M ¼ Mr;s of all r s matrices, let Eij be the matrix with ij-entry 1
and 0’s elsewhere. Then all such matrices form a basis of Mr;s called the usual or standard basis of
Mr;s . Accordingly, dim Mr;s ¼ rs.
(c) Vector space Pn ðtÞ of all polynomials of degree  n: The set S ¼ f1; t; t2 ; t3 ; . . . ; tn g of n þ 1
polynomials is a basis of Pn ðtÞ. Speciﬁcally, any polynomial f ðtÞ of degree  n can be expessed as a
linear combination of these powers of t, and one can show that these polynomials are linearly
independent. Therefore, dim Pn ðtÞ ¼ n þ 1.
(d) Vector space PðtÞ of all polynomials: Consider any ﬁnite set S ¼ ff1 ðtÞ; f2 ðtÞ; . . . ; fm ðtÞg of
polynomials in PðtÞ, and let m denote the largest of the degrees of the polynomials. Then any
polynomial gðtÞ of degree exceeding m cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the elements of
S. Thus, S cannot be a basis of PðtÞ. This means that the dimension of PðtÞ is inﬁnite. We note that the
inﬁnite set S 0 ¼ f1; t; t2 ; t3 ; . . .g, consisting of all the powers of t, spans PðtÞ and is linearly
independent. Accordingly, S 0 is an inﬁnite basis of PðtÞ.

Theorems on Bases
The following three theorems (proved in Problems 4.37, 4.38, and 4.39) will be used frequently.
THEOREM 4.14:

Let V be a vector space of ﬁnite dimension n. Then:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

THEOREM 4.15:

Any n þ 1 or more vectors in V are linearly dependent.
Any linearly independent set S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g with n elements is a basis
of V.
Any spanning set T ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g of V with n elements is a basis of V.

Suppose S spans a vector space V. Then:
(i) Any maximum number of linearly independent vectors in S form a basis of V.
(ii) Suppose one deletes from S every vector that is a linear combination of
preceding vectors in S. Then the remaining vectors form a basis of V.

126

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

THEOREM 4.16:

Let V be a vector space of ﬁnite dimension and let S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur g be a set of
linearly independent vectors in V. Then S is part of a basis of V; that is, S may be
extended to a basis of V.

EXAMPLE 4.11
(a) The following four vectors in R4 form a matrix in echelon form:

ð1; 1; 1; 1Þ; ð0; 1; 1; 1Þ; ð0; 0; 1; 1Þ; ð0; 0; 0; 1Þ
Thus, the vectors are linearly independent, and, because dim R4 ¼ 4, the four vectors form a basis of R4 .
(b) The following n þ 1 polynomials in Pn ðtÞ are of increasing degree:

1; t  1; ðt  1Þ2 ; . . . ; ðt  1Þn
Therefore, no polynomial is a linear combination of preceding polynomials; hence, the polynomials are linear
independent. Furthermore, they form a basis of Pn ðtÞ, because dim Pn ðtÞ ¼ n þ 1.
(c) Consider any four vectors in R3 , say

ð257; 132; 58Þ;

ð43; 0; 17Þ;

ð521; 317; 94Þ;

ð328; 512; 731Þ

By Theorem 4.14(i), the four vectors must be linearly dependent, because they come from the three-dimensional
vector space R3 .

Dimension and Subspaces
The following theorem (proved in Problem 4.40) gives the basic relationship between the dimension of a
vector space and the dimension of a subspace.
THEOREM 4.17:

Let W be a subspace of an n-dimensional vector space V. Then dim W  n. In
particular, if dim W ¼ n, then W ¼ V.

EXAMPLE 4.12 Let W be a subspace of the real space R3 . Note that dim R3 ¼ 3. Theorem 4.17 tells us that the
dimension of W can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The following cases apply:
(a) If dim W ¼ 0, then W ¼ f0g, a point.
(b) If dim W ¼ 1, then W is a line through the origin 0.
(c) If dim W ¼ 2, then W is a plane through the origin 0.
(d) If dim W ¼ 3, then W is the entire space R3 .

4.9

Application to Matrices, Rank of a Matrix

Let A be any m n matrix over a ﬁeld K. Recall that the rows of A may be viewed as vectors in K n and
that the row space of A, written rowsp(A), is the subspace of K n spanned by the rows of A. The following
deﬁnition applies.
DEFINITION:

The rank of a matrix A, written rank(A), is equal to the maximum number of linearly
independent rows of A or, equivalently, the dimension of the row space of A.

Recall, on the other hand, that the columns of an m n matrix A may be viewed as vectors in K m and
that the column space of A, written colsp(A), is the subspace of K m spanned by the columns of A.
Although m may not be equal to n—that is, the rows and columns of A may belong to different vector
spaces—we have the following fundamental result.
THEOREM 4.18:

The maximum number of linearly independent rows of any matrix A is equal to the
maximum number of linearly independent columns of A. Thus, the dimension of the
row space of A is equal to the dimension of the column space of A.

Accordingly, one could restate the above deﬁnition of the rank of A using columns instead of rows.

127

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Basis-Finding Problems
This subsection shows how an echelon form of any matrix A gives us the solution to certain problems
about A itself. Speciﬁcally, let A and B be the following matrices, where the echelon matrix B (whose
pivots are circled) is an echelon form of A:

We solve the following four problems about the matrix A, where C1 ; C2 ; . . . ; C6 denote its columns:
(a) Find a basis of the row space of A.
(b) Find each column Ck of A that is a linear combination of preceding columns of A.
(c) Find a basis of the column space of A.
(d) Find the rank of A.
(a)

We are given that A and B are row equivalent, so they have the same row space. Moreover, B is in
echelon form, so its nonzero rows are linearly independent and hence form a basis of the row space
of B. Thus, they also form a basis of the row space of A. That is,
basis of rowspðAÞ:

(b)

ð1; 2; 1; 3; 1; 2Þ;

ð0; 1; 3; 1; 2; 1Þ;

ð0; 0; 0; 1; 1; 2Þ

Let Mk ¼ ½C1 ; C2 ; . . . ; Ck , the submatrix of A consisting of the ﬁrst k columns of A. Then Mk1 and
Mk are, respectively, the coefﬁcient matrix and augmented matrix of the vector equation
x1 C1 þ x2 C2 þ    þ xk1 Ck1 ¼ Ck
Theorem 3.9 tells us that the system has a solution, or, equivalently, Ck is a linear combination of
the preceding columns of A if and only if rankðMk Þ ¼ rankðMk1 Þ, where rankðMk Þ means the
number of pivots in an echelon form of Mk . Now the ﬁrst k column of the echelon matrix B is also
an echelon form of Mk . Accordingly,
rankðM2 Þ ¼ rankðM3 Þ ¼ 2

(c)

and

rankðM4 Þ ¼ rankðM5 Þ ¼ rankðM6 Þ ¼ 3

Thus, C3 , C5 , C6 are each a linear combination of the preceding columns of A.
The fact that the remaining columns C1 , C2 , C4 are not linear combinations of their respective
preceding columns also tells us that they are linearly independent. Thus, they form a basis of the
column space of A. That is,
basis of colspðAÞ:

½1; 2; 3; 1; 2T ;

½2; 5; 7; 5; 6T ;

½3; 6; 11; 8; 11T

Observe that C1 , C2 , C4 may also be characterized as those columns of A that contain the pivots in
any echelon form of A.
(d) Here we see that three possible deﬁnitions of the rank of A yield the same value.
(i) There are three pivots in B, which is an echelon form of A.
(ii) The three pivots in B correspond to the nonzero rows of B, which form a basis of the row
space of A.
(iii) The three pivots in B correspond to the columns of A, which form a basis of the column space
of A.
Thus, rankðAÞ ¼ 3.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Application to Finding a Basis for W ¼ spanðu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur Þ
Frequently, we are given a list S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur g of vectors in K n and we want to ﬁnd a basis for the
subspace W of K n spanned by the given vectors—that is, a basis of
W ¼ spanðSÞ ¼ spanðu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur Þ
The following two algorithms, which are essentially described in the above subsection, ﬁnd such a basis
(and hence the dimension) of W.
Algorithm 4.1 (Row space algorithm)
Step 1. Form the matrix M whose rows are the given vectors.
Step 2. Row reduce M to echelon form.
Step 3. Output the nonzero rows of the echelon matrix.
Sometimes we want to ﬁnd a basis that only comes from the original given vectors. The next algorithm
accomplishes this task.
Algorithm 4.2 (Casting-out algorithm)
Step 1. Form the matrix M whose columns are the given vectors.
Step 2. Row reduce M to echelon form.
Step 3.

For each column Ck in the echelon matrix without a pivot, delete (cast out) the vector uk from
the list S of given vectors.

Step 4. Output the remaining vectors in S (which correspond to columns with pivots).
We emphasize that in the ﬁrst algorithm we form a matrix whose rows are the given vectors, whereas
in the second algorithm we form a matrix whose columns are the given vectors.
EXAMPLE 4.13

Let W be the subspace of R5 spanned by the following vectors:

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 1; 3; 2Þ;
u2 ¼ ð1; 3; 3; 5; 3Þ;
u3 ¼ ð3; 8; 7; 13; 8Þ
u5 ¼ ð5; 13; 13; 25; 19Þ
u4 ¼ ð1; 4; 6; 9; 7Þ;
Find a basis of W consisting of the original given vectors, and ﬁnd dim W.
Form the matrix M whose columns are the given vectors, and reduce M to echelon form:

The pivots in the echelon matrix appear in columns C1 , C2 , C4 . Accordingly, we ‘‘cast out’’ the vectors u3 and u5
from the original ﬁve vectors. The remaining vectors u1 , u2 , u4 , which correspond to the columns in the echelon
matrix with pivots, form a basis of W. Thus, in particular, dim W ¼ 3.

Remark: The justiﬁcation of the casting-out algorithm is essentially described above, but we repeat
it again here for emphasis. The fact that column C3 in the echelon matrix in Example 4.13 does not have a
pivot means that the vector equation
xu1 þ yu2 ¼ u3
has a solution, and hence u3 is a linear combination of u1 and u2 . Similarly, the fact that C5 does not have
a pivot means that u5 is a linear combination of the preceding vectors. We have deleted each vector in the
original spanning set that is a linear combination of preceding vectors. Thus, the remaining vectors are
linearly independent and form a basis of W.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Application to Homogeneous Systems of Linear Equations
Consider again a homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 of linear equations over K with n unknowns. By
Theorem 4.4, the solution set W of such a system is a subspace of K n , and hence W has a dimension.
The following theorem, whose proof is postponed until Chapter 5, holds.
The dimension of the solution space W of a homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 is n  r,
where n is the number of unknowns and r is the rank of the coefﬁcient matrix A.

THEOREM 4.19:

In the case where the system AX ¼ 0 is in echelon form, it has precisely n  r free variables, say
xi1 ; xi2 ; . . . ; xinr . Let v j be the solution obtained by setting xij ¼ 1 (or any nonzero constant) and the
remaining free variables equal to 0. We show (Problem 4.50) that the solutions v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v nr are
linearly independent; hence, they form a basis of the solution space W.
We have already used the above process to ﬁnd a basis of the solution space W of a homogeneous
system AX ¼ 0 in Section 3.11. Problem 4.48 gives three other examples.

Sums and Direct Sums

Let U and W be subsets of a vector space V. The sum of U and W, written U þ W, consists of all sums
u þ w where u 2 U and w 2 W. That is,
U þ W ¼ fv : v ¼ u þ w; where u 2 U and w 2 W g
Now suppose U and W are subspaces of V. Then one can easily show (Problem 4.53) that U þ W is a
subspace of V. Recall that U \ W is also a subspace of V. The following theorem (proved in Problem
4.58) relates the dimensions of these subspaces.
Suppose U and W are ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of a vector space V. Then
U þ W has ﬁnite dimension and

THEOREM 4.20:

dimðU þ W Þ ¼ dim U þ dim W  dimðU \ W Þ
EXAMPLE 4.14 Let V ¼ M2;2 , the vector space of 2 2 matrices. Let U consist of those matrices whose second
row is zero, and let W consist of those matrices whose second column is zero. Then

That is, U þ W consists of those matrices whose lower right entry is 0, and U \ W consists of those matrices
whose second row and second column are zero. Note that dim U ¼ 2, dim W ¼ 2, dimðU \ W Þ ¼ 1. Also,
dimðU þ W Þ ¼ 3, which is expected from Theorem 4.20. That is,
dimðU þ W Þ ¼ dim U þ dim V  dimðU \ W Þ ¼ 2 þ 2  1 ¼ 3
Direct Sums

The vector space V is said to be the direct sum of its subspaces U and W, denoted by
V ¼U

W

if every v 2 V can be written in one and only one way as v ¼ u þ w where u 2 U and w 2 W.
The following theorem (proved in Problem 4.59) characterizes such a decomposition.
THEOREM 4.21:

The vector space V is the direct sum of its subspaces U and W if and only if:
(i) V ¼ U þ W, (ii) U \ W ¼ f0g.

130

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

EXAMPLE 4.15

Consider the vector space V ¼ R3 :

(a) Let U be the xy-plane and let W be the yz-plane; that is,

U ¼ fða; b; 0Þ : a; b 2 Rg

W ¼ fð0; b; cÞ : b; c 2 Rg

and

Then R3 ¼ U þ W, because every vector in R3 is the sum of a vector in U and a vector in W. However, R3 is not
the direct sum of U and W, because such sums are not unique. For example,

ð3; 5; 7Þ ¼ ð3; 1; 0Þ þ ð0; 4; 7Þ

and also

ð3; 5; 7Þ ¼ ð3; 4; 0Þ þ ð0; 9; 7Þ

(b) Let U be the xy-plane and let W be the z-axis; that is,

U ¼ fða; b; 0Þ : a; b 2 Rg

and

W ¼ fð0; 0; cÞ : c 2 Rg

Now any vector ða; b; cÞ 2 R3 can be written as the sum of a vector in U and a vector in V in one and only one
way:

ða; b; cÞ ¼ ða; b; 0Þ þ ð0; 0; cÞ
Accordingly, R3 is the direct sum of U and W ; that is, R3 ¼ U

W.

General Direct Sums
The notion of a direct sum is extended to more than one factor in the obvious way. That is, V is the direct
sum of subspaces W1 ; W2 ; . . . ; Wr , written
V ¼ W1

Coordinates

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over K with basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g. Then any vector v 2 V
can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of the basis vectors in S, say
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un
These n scalars a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an are called the coordinates of v relative to the basis S, and they form a vector
[a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an ] in K n called the coordinate vector of v relative to S. We denote this vector by ½vS , or
simply ½v; when S is understood. Thus,
½vS ¼ ½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an 
For notational convenience, brackets ½. . ., rather than parentheses ð. . .Þ, are used to denote the coordinate
vector.

131

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Remark: The above n scalars a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an also form the coordinate column vector
½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an T of v relative to S. The choice of the column vector rather than the row vector to
represent v depends on the context in which it is used. The use of such column vectors will become clear
later in Chapter 6.
EXAMPLE 4.16

Consider the vector space P2 ðtÞ of polynomials of degree  2. The polynomials

p1 ¼ t þ 1;

p3 ¼ ðt  1Þ2 ¼ t2  2t þ 1

p2 ¼ t  1;

form a basis S of P2 ðtÞ. The coordinate vector [v] of v ¼ 2t2  5t þ 9 relative to S is obtained as follows.
Set v ¼ xp1 þ yp2 þ zp3 using unknown scalars x, y, z, and simplify:

2t2  5t þ 9 ¼ xðt þ 1Þ þ yðt  1Þ þ zðt2  2t þ 1Þ
¼ xt þ x þ yt  y þ zt2  2zt þ z
¼ zt2 þ ðx þ y  2zÞt þ ðx  y þ zÞ
Then set the coefﬁcients of the same powers of t equal to each other to obtain the system

z ¼ 2;

x þ y  2z ¼ 5;

xyþz¼9

The solution of the system is x ¼ 3, y ¼ 4, z ¼ 2. Thus,
v ¼ 3p1  4p2 þ 2p3 ; and hence; ½v ¼ ½3; 4; 2
EXAMPLE 4.17

Consider real space R3 . The following vectors form a basis S of R3 :

u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ;

u2 ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ;

u3 ¼ ð0; 1; 1Þ

The coordinates of v ¼ ð5; 3; 4Þ relative to the basis S are obtained as follows.
Set v ¼ xv 1 þ yv 2 þ zv 3 ; that is, set v as a linear combination of the basis vectors using unknown scalars x, y, z.
This yields

The equivalent system of linear equations is as follows:

x þ y ¼ 5;

x þ y þ z ¼ 3;

z¼4

The solution of the system is x ¼ 3, y ¼ 2, z ¼ 4. Thus,
v ¼ 3u1 þ 2u2 þ 4u3 ;

and so

½vs ¼ ½3; 2; 4

Remark 1: There is a geometrical interpretation of the coordinates of a vector v relative to a basis
S for the real space Rn , which we illustrate using the basis S of R3 in Example 4.17. First consider the
space R3 with the usual x, y, z axes. Then the basis vectors determine a new coordinate system of R3 , say
with x0 , y0 , z0 axes, as shown in Fig. 4-4. That is,
(1) The x0 -axis is in the direction of u1 with unit length ku1 k.
(2) The y0 -axis is in the direction of u2 with unit length ku2 k.
(3) The z0 -axis is in the direction of u3 with unit length ku3 k.
Then each vector v ¼ ða; b; cÞ or, equivalently, the point Pða; b; cÞ in R3 will have new coordinates with
respect to the new x0 , y0 , z0 axes. These new coordinates are precisely ½vS , the coordinates of v with
respect to the basis S. Thus, as shown in Example 4.17, the coordinates of the point Pð5; 3; 4Þ with the
new axes form the vector [3, 2, 4].
Remark 2:

Consider the usual basis E ¼ fe1 ; e2 ; . . . ; en g of K n deﬁned by

e1 ¼ ð1; 0; 0; . . . ; 0; 0Þ;

e2 ¼ ð0; 1; 0; . . . ; 0; 0Þ;

...;

en ¼ ð0; 0; 0; . . . ; 0; 1Þ

132

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Figure 4-4

Let v ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ be any vector in K n . Then one can easily show that
v ¼ a1 e1 þ a2 e2 þ    þ an en ;

and so

½vE ¼ ½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an 

That is, the coordinate vector ½vE of any vector v relative to the usual basis E of K n is identical to the
original vector v.

Isomorphism of V and K n
Let V be a vector space of dimension n over K, and suppose S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is a basis of V. Then
each vector v 2 V corresponds to a unique n-tuple ½vS in K n . On the other hand, each n-tuple
[c1 ; c2 ; . . . ; cn ] in K n corresponds to a unique vector c1 u1 þ c2 u2 þ    þ cn un in V. Thus, the basis S
induces a one-to-one correspondence between V and K n . Furthermore, suppose
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un

and

w ¼ b1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ    þ bn un

Then
v þ w ¼ ða1 þ b1 Þu1 þ ða2 þ b2 Þu2 þ    þ ðan þ bn Þun
kv ¼ ðka1 Þu1 þ ðka2 Þu2 þ    þ ðkan Þun
where k is a scalar. Accordingly,
½v þ wS ¼ ½a1 þ b1 ;

Thus, the above one-to-one correspondence between V and K n preserves the vector space operations of
vector addition and scalar multiplication. We then say that V and K n are isomorphic, written
V ﬃ Kn
We state this result formally.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld K. Then V and K n are
isomorphic.
The next example gives a practical application of the above result.

Suppose we want to determine whether or not the following matrices in V ¼ M2;3 are linearly

The coordinate vectors of the matrices in the usual basis of M2;3 are as follows:

½A ¼ ½1; 2; 3; 4; 0; 1;

½B ¼ ½1; 3; 4; 6; 5; 4;

½C ¼ ½3; 8; 11; 16; 10; 9

Form the matrix M whose rows are the above coordinate vectors and reduce M to an echelon form:

Because the echelon matrix has only two nonzero rows, the coordinate vectors [A], [B], [C] span a subspace of
dimension 2 and so are linearly dependent. Accordingly, the original matrices A, B, C are linearly dependent.

Vector Spaces, Linear Combinations
4.1.

Suppose u and v belong to a vector space V. Simplify each of the following expressions:
(a)
(b)

E1 ¼ 3ð2u  4vÞ þ 5u þ 7v,

(c) E3 ¼ 2uv þ 3ð2u þ 4vÞ
3
E2 ¼ 3u  6ð3u  5vÞ þ 7u, (d) E4 ¼ 5u  þ 5u
v

Multiply out and collect terms:
(a) E1 ¼ 6u  12v þ 5u þ 7v ¼ 11u  5v
(b) E2 ¼ 3u  18u þ 30v þ 7u ¼ 8u þ 30v
(c) E3 is not deﬁned because the product uv of vectors is not deﬁned.
(d) E4 is not deﬁned because division by a vector is not deﬁned.

4.2.

Prove Theorem 4.1: Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K.
(i) k0 ¼ 0. (ii) 0u ¼ 0. (iii) If ku ¼ 0, then k ¼ 0 or u ¼ 0. (iv) ðkÞu ¼ kðuÞ ¼ ku.
(i) By Axiom [A2] with u ¼ 0, we have 0 þ 0 ¼ 0. Hence, by Axiom [M1], we have
k0 ¼ kð0 þ 0Þ ¼ k0 þ k0
Adding k0 to both sides gives the desired result.
(ii)

For scalars, 0 þ 0 ¼ 0. Hence, by Axiom [M2], we have
0u ¼ ð0 þ 0Þu ¼ 0u þ 0u
Adding 0u to both sides gives the desired result.

(iii)

Suppose ku ¼ 0 and k 6¼ 0. Then there exists a scalar k 1 such that k 1 k ¼ 1. Thus,
u ¼ 1u ¼ ðk 1 kÞu ¼ k 1 ðkuÞ ¼ k 1 0 ¼ 0

(iv) Using u þ ðuÞ ¼ 0 and k þ ðkÞ ¼ 0 yields
0 ¼ k0 ¼ k½u þ ðuÞ ¼ ku þ kðuÞ

and

0 ¼ 0u ¼ ½k þ ðkÞu ¼ ku þ ðkÞu

Adding ku to both sides of the ﬁrst equation gives ku ¼ kðuÞ; and adding ku to both sides of the
second equation gives ku ¼ ðkÞu. Thus, ðkÞu ¼ kðuÞ ¼ ku.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Show that (a) kðu  vÞ ¼ ku  kv, (b) u þ u ¼ 2u.
(a)

Using the deﬁnition of subtraction, that u  v ¼ u þ ðvÞ, and Theorem 4.1(iv), that kðvÞ ¼ kv, we
have
kðu  vÞ ¼ k½u þ ðvÞ ¼ ku þ kðvÞ ¼ ku þ ðkvÞ ¼ ku  kv

(b)

Using Axiom [M4] and then Axiom [M2], we have
u þ u ¼ 1u þ 1u ¼ ð1 þ 1Þu ¼ 2u

4.4.

Express v ¼ ð1; 2; 5Þ in R3 as a linear combination of the vectors
u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ;

u2 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

u3 ¼ ð2; 1; 1Þ

We seek scalars x, y, z, as yet unknown, such that v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 . Thus, we require

or
x þ 2y  z ¼ 2
5
1
3
1
x þ 3y þ z ¼ 5
(For notational convenience, we write the vectors in R3 as columns, because it is then easier to ﬁnd the
equivalent system of linear equations.) Reducing the system to echelon form yields the triangular system
x þ y þ 2z ¼ 1;

y  3z ¼ 3;

5z ¼ 10

The system is consistent and has a solution. Solving by back-substitution yields the solution x ¼ 6, y ¼ 3,
z ¼ 2. Thus, v ¼ 6u1 þ 3u2 þ 2u3 .
Alternatively, write down the augmented matrix M of the equivalent system of linear equations, where
u1 , u2 , u3 are the ﬁrst three columns of M and v is the last column, and then reduce M to echelon form:

The last matrix corresponds to a triangular system, which has a solution. Solving the triangular system by
back-substitution yields the solution x ¼ 6, y ¼ 3, z ¼ 2. Thus, v ¼ 6u1 þ 3u2 þ 2u3 .

4.5.

Express v ¼ ð2; 5; 3Þ in R3 as a linear combination of the vectors
u1 ¼ ð1; 3; 2Þ; u2 ¼ ð2; 4; 1Þ; u3 ¼ ð1; 5; 7Þ
We seek scalars x, y, z, as yet unknown, such that v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 . Thus, we require

1
2

Reducing the system to echelon form yields the system
x þ 2y þ z ¼ 2;

2y  2z ¼ 1;

0¼3

The system is inconsistent and so has no solution. Thus, v cannot be written as a linear combination of
u1 , u2 , u3 .

4.6.

Express the polynomial v ¼ t2 þ 4t  3 in PðtÞ as a linear combination of the polynomials
p1 ¼ t2  2t þ 5;

p2 ¼ 2t 2  3t;

p3 ¼ t þ 1

Set v as a linear combination of p1 , p2 , p3 using unknowns x, y, z to obtain
t2 þ 4t  3 ¼ xðt2  2t þ 5Þ þ yð2t2  3tÞ þ zðt þ 1Þ
We can proceed in two ways.

ð*Þ

135

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
Method 1. Expand the right side of (*) and express it in terms of powers of t as follows:
t2 þ 4t  3 ¼ xt2  2xt þ 5x þ 2yt2  3yt þ zt þ z
¼ ðx þ 2yÞt2 þ ð2x  3y þ zÞt þ ð5x þ 3zÞ

Set coefﬁcients of the same powers of t equal to each other, and reduce the system to echelon form. This
yields
x þ 2y ¼ 1
2x  3y þ z ¼ 4
5x þ 3z ¼ 3

or

x þ 2y ¼ 1
yþ z¼ 6
10y þ 3z ¼ 8

or

x þ 2y ¼ 1
yþ z¼ 6
13z ¼ 52

The system is consistent and has a solution. Solving by back-substitution yields the solution x ¼ 3, y ¼ 2,
z ¼ 4. Thus, v ¼ 3p1 þ 2p2 þ 4p2 .
Method 2. The equation (*) is an identity in t; that is, the equation holds for any value of t. Thus, we can
set t equal to any numbers to obtain equations in the unknowns.
(a) Set t ¼ 0 in (*) to obtain the equation 3 ¼ 5x þ z.
(b) Set t ¼ 1 in (*) to obtain the equation 2 ¼ 4x  y þ 2z.
(c) Set t ¼ 1 in (*) to obtain the equation 6 ¼ 8x þ 5y.
Solve the system of the three equations to again obtain the solution x ¼ 3, y ¼ 2, z ¼ 4. Thus,
v ¼ 3p1 þ 2p2 þ 4p3 .

Reducing the system to echelon form yields

x þ 3y þ 4z ¼ 7;

x þ 4y þ 5z ¼ 9

x þ y þ z ¼ 4;
y ¼ 3;
3z ¼ 3;
4z ¼ 4
The last equation drops out. Solving the system by back-substitution yields z ¼ 1, y ¼ 3, x ¼ 2. Thus,
M ¼ 2A þ 3B  C.

Subspaces
4.8.

Prove Theorem 4.2: W is a subspace of V if the following two conditions hold:
(a)

0 2 W. (b) If u; v 2 W, then u þ v, ku 2 W.

By (a), W is nonempty, and, by (b), the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are well
deﬁned for W. Axioms [A1], [A4], [M1], [M2], [M3], [M4] hold in W because the vectors in W belong to V.
Thus, we need only show that [A2] and [A3] also hold in W. Now [A2] holds because the zero vector in V
belongs to W by (a). Finally, if v 2 W, then ð1Þv ¼ v 2 W, and v þ ðvÞ ¼ 0. Thus [A3] holds.

4.9.

Let V ¼ R3 . Show that W is not a subspace of V, where
(a)

W ¼ fða; b; cÞ : a  0g, (b) W ¼ fða; b; cÞ : a2 þ b2 þ c2  1g.

In each case, show that Theorem 4.2 does not hold.

136

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

W consists of those vectors whose ﬁrst entry is nonnegative. Thus, v ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ belongs to W. Let
k ¼ 3. Then kv ¼ ð3; 6; 9Þ does not belong to W, because 3 is negative. Thus, W is not a
subspace of V.
(b) W consists of vectors whose length does not exceed 1. Hence, u ¼ ð1; 0; 0Þ and v ¼ ð0; 1; 0Þ belong to
W, but u þ v ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ does not belong to W, because 12 þ 12 þ 02 ¼ 2 > 1. Thus, W is not a
subspace of V.

(a)

4.10. Let V ¼ PðtÞ, the vector space of real polynomials. Determine whether or not W is a subspace of
V, where
(a)

W consists of all polynomials with integral coefﬁcients.

(b)

W consists of all polynomials with degree  6 and the zero polynomial.

(c)

W consists of all polynomials with only even powers of t.

(a)

No, because scalar multiples of polynomials in W do not always belong to W. For example,
f ðtÞ ¼ 3 þ 6t þ 7t2 2 W

but

1
3
7 2
2 f ðtÞ ¼ 2 þ 3t þ 2 t 62 W

(b and c) Yes. In each case, W contains the zero polynomial, and sums and scalar multiples of polynomials
in W belong to W.

4.11. Let V be the vector space of functions f : R ! R. Show that W is a subspace of V, where
(a)

W ¼ f f ðxÞ : f ð1Þ ¼ 0g, all functions whose value at 1 is 0.

(b)

W ¼ f f ðxÞ : f ð3Þ ¼ f ð1Þg, all functions assigning the same value to 3 and 1.

(c)

W ¼ f f ðtÞ : f ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞg, all odd functions.

Let ^0 denote the zero function, so ^
0ðxÞ ¼ 0 for every value of x.
^
^
(a) 0 2 W, because 0ð1Þ ¼ 0. Suppose f ; g 2 W. Then f ð1Þ ¼ 0 and gð1Þ ¼ 0. Also, for scalars a and b, we
have
ðaf þ bgÞð1Þ ¼ af ð1Þ þ bgð1Þ ¼ a0 þ b0 ¼ 0
(b)

Thus, af þ bg 2 W, and hence W is a subspace.
^
0 2 W, because ^
0ð3Þ ¼ 0 ¼ ^
0ð1Þ. Suppose f; g 2 W. Then f ð3Þ ¼ f ð1Þ and gð3Þ ¼ gð1Þ. Thus, for any
scalars a and b, we have
ðaf þ bgÞð3Þ ¼ af ð3Þ þ bgð3Þ ¼ af ð1Þ þ bgð1Þ ¼ ðaf þ bgÞð1Þ

Thus, af þ bg 2 W, and hence W is a subspace.
(c) ^0 2 W, because ^
0ðxÞ ¼ 0 ¼ 0 ¼ ^
0ðxÞ. Suppose f; g 2 W. Then f ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ and gðxÞ ¼ gðxÞ.
Also, for scalars a and b,
ðaf þ bgÞðxÞ ¼ af ðxÞ þ bgðxÞ ¼ af ðxÞ  bgðxÞ ¼ ðaf þ bgÞðxÞ
Thus, ab þ gf 2 W, and hence W is a subspace of V.

4.12. Prove Theorem 4.3: The intersection of any number of subspaces of V is a subspace of V.
Let fWi : i 2 Ig be a collection of subspaces of V and let W ¼ \ðWi : i 2 IÞ. Because each Wi is a
subspace of V, we have 0 2 Wi , for every i 2 I. Hence, 0 2 W. Suppose u; v 2 W. Then u; v 2 Wi , for every
i 2 I. Because each Wi is a subspace, au þ bv 2 Wi , for every i 2 I. Hence, au þ bv 2 W. Thus, W is a
subspace of V.

Linear Spans
4.13. Show that the vectors u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ, u2 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, u3 ¼ ð1; 5; 8Þ span R3 .
We need to show that an arbitrary vector v ¼ ða; b; cÞ in R3 is a linear combination of u1 , u2 , u3 . Set
v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 ; that is, set
ða; b; cÞ ¼ xð1; 1; 1Þ þ yð1; 2; 3Þ þ zð1; 5; 8Þ ¼ ðx þ y þ z;

x þ 2y þ 5z;

x þ 3y þ 8zÞ

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
Form the equivalent system and reduce it to echelon form:
xþ yþ z¼a
xþyþ z¼a
x þ 2y þ 5z ¼ b
or
y þ 4z ¼ b  a
or
x þ 3y þ 8z ¼ c
2y þ 7c ¼ c  a
The above system is in echelon form and is consistent; in fact,

xþyþ z¼a
y þ 4z ¼ b  a
z ¼ c  2b þ a

x ¼ a þ 5b  3c; y ¼ 3a  7b þ 4c; z ¼ a þ 2b  c
is a solution. Thus, u1 , u2 , u3 span R3 .

4.14. Find conditions on a, b, c so that v ¼ ða; b; cÞ in R3 belongs to W ¼ spanðu1 ; u2 ; u3 Þ; where
u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 0Þ; u2 ¼ ð1; 1; 2Þ; u3 ¼ ð3; 0; 4Þ
Set v as a linear combination of u1 , u2 , u3 using unknowns x, y, z; that is, set v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 : This
yields
ða; b; cÞ ¼ xð1; 2; 0Þ þ yð1; 1; 2Þ þ zð3; 0; 4Þ ¼ ðx  y þ 3z; 2x þ y; 2y  4zÞ

2y  4z ¼ c

x  y þ 3z ¼ a
3y  6z ¼ b  2a
2y  4z ¼ c

or

x  y þ 3z ¼ a
3y  6z ¼ b  2a
0 ¼ 4a  2b þ 3c

or

The vector v ¼ ða; b; cÞ belongs to W if and only if the system is consistent, and it is consistent if and only if
4a  2b þ 3c ¼ 0. Note, in particular, that u1 , u2 , u3 do not span the whole space R3 .

4.15. Show that the vector space V ¼ PðtÞ of real polynomials cannot be spanned by a ﬁnite number of
polynomials.
Any ﬁnite set S of polynomials contains a polynomial of maximum degree, say m. Then the linear span
span(S) of S cannot contain a polynomial of degree greater than m. Thus, spanðSÞ 6¼ V, for any ﬁnite set S.

4.16. Prove Theorem 4.5: Let S be a subset of V. (i) Then span(S) is a subspace of V containing S.
(ii) If W is a subspace of V containing S, then spanðSÞ  W.
(i) Suppose S is empty. By deﬁnition, spanðSÞ ¼ f0g. Hence spanðSÞ ¼ f0g is a subspace of V and
S  spanðSÞ. Suppose S is not empty and v 2 S. Then v ¼ 1v 2 spanðSÞ; hence, S  spanðSÞ. Also
0 ¼ 0v 2 spanðSÞ. Now suppose u; w 2 spanðSÞ, say
P

and
w ¼ b1 w1 þ    þ bs ws ¼ bj wj

(ii)

Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur 2 S. Then all the ui belong to W. Thus, all multiples a1 u1 ; a2 u2 ; . . . ; ar ur 2 W,
and so the sum a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ ar ur 2 W. That is, W contains all linear combinations of elements
in S, or, in other words, spanðSÞ  W, as claimed.

Linear Dependence
4.17. Determine whether or not u and v are linearly dependent, where
(a)

u ¼ ð1; 2Þ, v ¼ ð3; 5Þ,

(c) u ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, v ¼ ð4; 5; 6Þ

(b)

u ¼ ð1; 3Þ, v ¼ ð2; 6Þ,

(d) u ¼ ð2; 4; 8Þ, v ¼ ð3; 6; 12Þ

Two vectors u and v are linearly dependent if and only if one is a multiple of the other.
(a) No. (b) Yes; for v ¼ 2u. (c) No. (d) Yes, for v ¼ 32 u.

(a) Yes; for v ¼ 2u. (b) No. (c) Yes, for v ¼ 4u. (d) No.

4.19. Determine whether or not the vectors u ¼ ð1; 1; 2Þ, v ¼ ð2; 3; 1Þ, w ¼ ð4; 5; 5Þ in R3 are linearly
dependent.
Method 1. Set a linear combination of u, v, w equal to the zero vector using unknowns x, y, z to obtain
the equivalent homogeneous system of linear equations and then reduce the system to echelon form.
This yields

x þ 3y þ 5z ¼ 0
2x þ y þ 5z ¼ 0

or

x þ 2y þ 4z ¼ 0
yþ z¼0

The echelon system has only two nonzero equations in three unknowns; hence, it has a free variable and a
nonzero solution. Thus, u, v, w are linearly dependent.
Method 2. Form the matrix A whose columns are u, v, w and reduce to echelon form:
2

A ¼ 41 3 55 40

2 1 5
0 3 3
0 0 0
The third column does not have a pivot; hence, the third vector w is a linear combination of the ﬁrst two
vectors u and v. Thus, the vectors are linearly dependent. (Observe that the matrix A is also the coefﬁcient
matrix in Method 1. In other words, this method is essentially the same as the ﬁrst method.)
Method 3. Form the matrix B whose rows are u, v, w, and reduce to echelon form:

B ¼ 4 2 3 1 5 4 0 1 3 5 4 0 1 3 5

4 5 5
Because the echelon matrix has only two nonzero rows, the three vectors are linearly dependent. (The three
given vectors span a space of dimension 2.)

4.20. Determine whether or not each of the following lists of vectors in R3 is linearly dependent:
(a)

u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 5Þ, u2 ¼ ð1; 3; 1Þ, u3 ¼ ð2; 5; 7Þ, u4 ¼ ð3; 1; 4Þ,

(b)

u ¼ ð1; 2; 5Þ, v ¼ ð2; 5; 1Þ, w ¼ ð1; 5; 2Þ,

(c)

u ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, v ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ, w ¼ ð1; 5; 6Þ.

(a) Yes, because any four vectors in R3 are linearly dependent.
(b) Use Method 2 above; that is, form the matrix A whose columns are the given vectors, and reduce the
matrix to echelon form:
2
3 2

A ¼ 42 5 55 40

Every column has a pivot entry; hence, no vector is a linear combination of the previous vectors. Thus,
the vectors are linearly independent.
(c) Because 0 ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ is one of the vectors, the vectors are linearly dependent.

4.21. Show that the functions f ðtÞ ¼ sin t, gðtÞ cos t, hðtÞ ¼ t from R into R are linearly independent.
Set a linear combination of the functions equal to the zero function 0 using unknown scalars x, y, z; that
is, set xf þ yg þ zh ¼ 0. Then show x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, z ¼ 0. We emphasize that xf þ yg þ zh ¼ 0 means that,
for every value of t, we have xf ðtÞ þ ygðtÞ þ zhðtÞ ¼ 0.
Thus, in the equation x sin t þ y cos t þ zt ¼ 0:

ðiiÞ Set t ¼ p=2

x þ pz=2 ¼ 0:
y þ pz ¼ 0:

The three equations have only the zero solution; that is, x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, z ¼ 0. Thus, f , g, h are linearly
independent.

4.22. Suppose the vectors u, v, w are linearly independent. Show that the vectors u þ v, u  v,
u  2v þ w are also linearly independent.
Suppose xðu þ vÞ þ yðu  vÞ þ zðu  2v þ wÞ ¼ 0. Then
xu þ xv þ yu  yv þ zu  2zv þ zw ¼ 0
or
ðx þ y þ zÞu þ ðx  y  2zÞv þ zw ¼ 0
Because u, v, w are linearly independent, the coefﬁcients in the above equation are each 0; hence,
x þ y þ z ¼ 0;

x  y  2z ¼ 0;

z¼0

The only solution to the above homogeneous system is x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, z ¼ 0. Thus, u þ v, u  v, u  2v þ w
are linearly independent.

4.23. Show that the vectors u ¼ ð1 þ i; 2iÞ and w ¼ ð1; 1 þ iÞ in C2 are linearly dependent over the
complex ﬁeld C but linearly independent over the real ﬁeld R.
Recall that two vectors are linearly dependent (over a ﬁeld K) if and only if one of them is a multiple of
the other (by an element in K). Because
ð1 þ iÞw ¼ ð1 þ iÞð1; 1 þ iÞ ¼ ð1 þ i; 2iÞ ¼ u
u and w are linearly dependent over C. On the other hand, u and w are linearly independent over R, as no real
multiple of w can equal u. Speciﬁcally, when k is real, the ﬁrst component of kw ¼ ðk; k þ kiÞ must be real,
and it can never equal the ﬁrst component 1 þ i of u, which is complex.

Basis and Dimension
4.24. Determine whether or not each of the following form a basis of R3 :
(a)

(1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1);

(c)

(b)

(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 5), (1, 0, 1), (2, 3, 0);

(1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 3), ð2; 1; 1Þ;

(d) (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 5), (5, 3, 4).

(a and b) No, because a basis of R must contain exactly three elements because dim R3 ¼ 3.
(c) The three vectors form a basis if and only if they are linearly independent. Thus, form the matrix whose
rows are the given vectors, and row reduce the matrix to echelon form:

The echelon matrix has no zero rows; hence, the three vectors are linearly independent, and so they do
form a basis of R3 .

The echelon matrix has a zero row; hence, the three vectors are linearly dependent, and so they do not
form a basis of R3 .

4.25. Determine whether (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 3, 2), (2, 5, 6, 4), (2, 6, 8, 5) form a basis of R4 . If not, ﬁnd
the dimension of the subspace they span.

The echelon matrix has a zero row. Hence, the four vectors are linearly dependent and do not form a basis of
R4 . Because the echelon matrix has three nonzero rows, the four vectors span a subspace of dimension 3.

4.26. Extend fu1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1; 1Þ; u2 ¼ ð2; 2; 3; 4Þg to a basis of R4 .
First form the matrix with rows u1 and u2 , and reduce to echelon form:


 
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
2 2 3 4
0 0 1 2
Then w1 ¼ ð1; 1; 1; 1Þ and w2 ¼ ð0; 0; 1; 2Þ span the same set of vectors as spanned by u1 and u2 . Let
u3 ¼ ð0; 1; 0; 0Þ and u4 ¼ ð0; 0; 0; 1Þ. Then w1 , u3 , w2 , u4 form a matrix in echelon form. Thus, they are
linearly independent, and they form a basis of R4 . Hence, u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 also form a basis of R4 .

4.27. Consider the complex ﬁeld C, which contains the real ﬁeld R, which contains the rational ﬁeld Q.
(Thus, C is a vector space over R, and R is a vector space over Q.)
(a)

Show that f1; ig is a basis of C over R; hence, C is a vector space of dimension 2 over R.

(b)

Show that R is a vector space of inﬁnite dimension over Q.

For any v 2 C, we have v ¼ a þ bi ¼ að1Þ þ bðiÞ, where a; b 2 R. Hence, f1; ig spans C over R.
Furthermore, if xð1Þ þ yðiÞ ¼ 0 or x þ yi ¼ 0, where x, y 2 R, then x ¼ 0 and y ¼ 0. Hence, f1; ig is
linearly independent over R. Thus, f1; ig is a basis for C over R.
(b) It can be shown that p is a transcendental number; that is, p is not a root of any polynomial over Q.
Thus, for any n, the n þ 1 real numbers 1; p; p2 ; . . . ; pn are linearly independent over Q. R cannot be of
dimension n over Q. Accordingly, R is of inﬁnite dimension over Q.
(a)

4.28. Suppose S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is a subset of V. Show that the following Deﬁnitions A and B of a
basis of V are equivalent:
(A)

S is linearly independent and spans V.

(B)

Every v 2 V is a unique linear combination of vectors in S.
Suppose (A) holds. Because S spans V, the vector v is a linear combination of the ui , say
u ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un

and

u ¼ b1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ    þ bn un

Subtracting, we get
0 ¼ v  v ¼ ða1  b1 Þu1 þ ða2  b2 Þu2 þ    þ ðan  bn Þun

141

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
But the ui are linearly independent. Hence, the coefﬁcients in the above relation are each 0:
a1  b1 ¼ 0;

a2  b2 ¼ 0;

...;

an  bn ¼ 0

Therefore, a1 ¼ b1 ; a2 ¼ b2 ; . . . ; an ¼ bn . Hence, the representation of v as a linear combination of the ui is
unique. Thus, (A) implies (B).
Suppose (B) holds. Then S spans V. Suppose
0 ¼ c1 u1 þ c2 u2 þ    þ cn un
However, we do have
0 ¼ 0u1 þ 0u2 þ    þ 0un
By hypothesis, the representation of 0 as a linear combination of the ui is unique. Hence, each ci ¼ 0 and the
ui are linearly independent. Thus, (B) implies (A).

Dimension and Subspaces
4.29. Find a basis and dimension of the subspace W of R3 where
(a) W ¼ fða; b; cÞ : a þ b þ c ¼ 0g,
(b) W ¼ fða; b; cÞ : ða ¼ b ¼ cÞg
(a) Note that W 6¼ R3 , because, for example, ð1; 2; 3Þ 62 W. Thus, dim W < 3. Note that u1 ¼ ð1; 0; 1Þ
and u2 ¼ ð0; 1; 1Þ are two independent vectors in W. Thus, dim W ¼ 2, and so u1 and u2 form a basis
of W.
(b) The vector u ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ 2 W. Any vector w 2 W has the form w ¼ ðk; k; kÞ. Hence, w ¼ ku. Thus, u
spans W and dim W ¼ 1.

4.30. Let W be the subspace of R4 spanned by the vectors
u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 5; 3Þ;

u2 ¼ ð2; 3; 1; 4Þ;

u3 ¼ ð3; 8; 3; 5Þ

(b) Extend the basis of W to a basis of R4 .

(a)

Find a basis and dimension of W.

(a)

Apply Algorithm 4.1, the row space algorithm. Form the matrix whose rows are the given vectors, and
reduce it to echelon form:

The nonzero rows ð1; 2; 5; 3Þ and ð0; 7; 9; 2Þ of the echelon matrix form a basis of the row space
of A and hence of W. Thus, in particular, dim W ¼ 2.
(b) We seek four linearly independent vectors, which include the above two vectors. The four vectors
ð1; 2; 5; 3Þ, ð0; 7; 9; 2Þ, (0, 0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 0, 1) are linearly independent (because they form an
echelon matrix), and so they form a basis of R4 , which is an extension of the basis of W.

4.31. Let W be the subspace of R5 spanned by u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 1; 3; 4Þ, u2 ¼ ð2; 4; 2; 6; 8Þ,
u3 ¼ ð1; 3; 2; 2; 6Þ, u4 ¼ ð1; 4; 5; 1; 8Þ, u5 ¼ ð2; 7; 3; 3; 9Þ. Find a subset of the vectors that
form a basis of W.
Here we use Algorithm 4.2, the casting-out algorithm. Form the matrix M whose columns (not rows)
are the given vectors, and reduce it to echelon form:

The pivot positions are in columns C1 , C3 , C5 . Hence, the corresponding vectors u1 , u3 , u5 form a basis of W,
and dim W ¼ 3.

Show that dim W ¼ 3, by ﬁnding a basis of W.

Setting corresponding entries equal to each other yields x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0, z ¼ 0. Thus, S is linearly independent.
Therefore, S is a basis of W, as claimed.

Theorems on Linear Dependence, Basis, and Dimension
4.33. Prove Lemma 4.10: Suppose two or more nonzero vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m are linearly dependent.
Then one of them is a linear combination of the preceding vectors.
Because the v i are linearly dependent, there exist scalars a1 ; . . . ; am , not all 0, such that
a1 v 1 þ    þ am v m ¼ 0. Let k be the largest integer such that ak 6¼ 0. Then
a1 v 1 þ    þ ak v k þ 0v kþ1 þ    þ 0v m ¼ 0

or

a1 v 1 þ    þ ak v k ¼ 0

Suppose k ¼ 1; then a1 v 1 ¼ 0, a1 6¼ 0, and so v 1 ¼ 0. But the v i are nonzero vectors. Hence, k > 1 and
1
v k ¼ a1
k a1 v 1      ak ak1 v k1

That is, v k is a linear combination of the preceding vectors.

4.34. Suppose S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m g spans a vector space V.
(a)

If w 2 V, then fw; v 1 ; . . . ; v m g is linearly dependent and spans V.

(b)

If v i is a linear combination of v 1 ; . . . ; v i1 , then S without v i spans V.

The vector w is a linear combination of the v i , because fv i g spans V. Accordingly, fw; v 1 ; . . . ; v m g is
linearly dependent. Clearly, w with the v i span V, as the v i by themselves span V; that is, fw; v 1 ; . . . ; v m g
spans V.
(b) Suppose v i ¼ k1 v 1 þ    þ ki1 v i1 . Let u 2 V. Because fv i g spans V, u is a linear combination of the
v j ’s, say u ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ am v m : Substituting for v i , we obtain
(a)

u ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ ai1 v i1 þ ai ðk1 v 1 þ    þ ki1 v i1 Þ þ aiþ1 v iþ1 þ    þ am v m
¼ ða1 þ ai k1 Þv 1 þ    þ ðai1 þ ai ki1 Þv i1 þ aiþ1 v iþ1 þ    þ am v m
Thus, fv 1 ; . . . ; v i1 ; v iþ1 ; . . . ; v m g spans V. In other words, we can delete v i from the spanning set and still
retain a spanning set.

4.35. Prove Lemma 4.13: Suppose fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g spans V, and suppose fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wm g is linearly
independent. Then m  n, and V is spanned by a set of the form
fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wm ; v i1 ; v i2 ; . . . ; v inm g
Thus, any n þ 1 or more vectors in V are linearly dependent.

143

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

It sufﬁces to prove the lemma in the case that the v i are all not 0. (Prove!) Because fv i g spans V, we
have by Problem 4.34 that
ð1Þ
fw1 ; v 1 ; . . . ; v n g
is linearly dependent and also spans V. By Lemma 4.10, one of the vectors in (1) is a linear combination of
the preceding vectors. This vector cannot be w1 , so it must be one of the v’s, say v j : Thus by Problem 4.34,
we can delete v j from the spanning set (1) and obtain the spanning set
fw1 ; v 1 ; . . . ; v j1 ; v jþ1 ; . . . ; v n g

ð2Þ

Now we repeat the argument with the vector w2 . That is, because (2) spans V, the set
fw1 ; w2 ; v 1 ; . . . ; v j1 ; v jþ1 ; . . . ; v n g

ð3Þ

is linearly dependent and also spans V. Again by Lemma 4.10, one of the vectors in (3) is a linear
combination of the preceding vectors. We emphasize that this vector cannot be w1 or w2 , because
fw1 ; . . . ; wm g is independent; hence, it must be one of the v’s, say v k . Thus, by Problem 4.34, we can
delete v k from the spanning set (3) and obtain the spanning set
fw1 ; w2 ; v 1 ; . . . ; v j1 ; v jþ1 ; . . . ; v k1 ; v kþ1 ; . . . ; v n g
We repeat the argument with w3 , and so forth. At each step, we are able to add one of the w’s and delete
one of the v’s in the spanning set. If m  n, then we ﬁnally obtain a spanning set of the required form:
fw1 ; . . . ; wm ; v i1 ; . . . ; v inm g
Finally, we show that m > n is not possible. Otherwise, after n of the above steps, we obtain the
spanning set fw1 ; . . . ; wn g. This implies that wnþ1 is a linear combination of w1 ; . . . ; wn , which contradicts
the hypothesis that fwi g is linearly independent.

4.36. Prove Theorem 4.12: Every basis of a vector space V has the same number of elements.
Suppose fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is a basis of V, and suppose fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . .g is another basis of V. Because fui g
spans V, the basis fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . .g must contain n or less vectors, or else it is linearly dependent by
Problem 4.35—Lemma 4.13. On the other hand, if the basis fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . .g contains less than n elements,
then fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is linearly dependent by Problem 4.35. Thus, the basis fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . .g contains exactly n
vectors, and so the theorem is true.

4.37. Prove Theorem 4.14: Let V be a vector space of ﬁnite dimension n. Then
(i) Any n þ 1 or more vectors must be linearly dependent.
(ii) Any linearly independent set S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . un g with n elements is a basis of V.
(iii) Any spanning set T ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g of V with n elements is a basis of V.
Suppose B ¼ fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn g is a basis of V.
(i) Because B spans V, any n þ 1 or more vectors are linearly dependent by Lemma 4.13.
(ii) By Lemma 4.13, elements from B can be adjoined to S to form a spanning set of V with n elements.
Because S already has n elements, S itself is a spanning set of V. Thus, S is a basis of V.
(iii) Suppose T is linearly dependent. Then some v i is a linear combination of the preceding vectors. By
Problem 4.34, V is spanned by the vectors in T without v i and there are n  1 of them. By Lemma
4.13, the independent set B cannot have more than n  1 elements. This contradicts the fact that B has
n elements. Thus, T is linearly independent, and hence T is a basis of V.

4.38. Prove Theorem 4.15: Suppose S spans a vector space V. Then
(i) Any maximum number of linearly independent vectors in S form a basis of V.
(ii) Suppose one deletes from S every vector that is a linear combination of preceding vectors in
S. Then the remaining vectors form a basis of V.
(i) Suppose fv 1 ; . . . ; v m g is a maximum linearly independent subset of S, and suppose w 2 S. Accordingly, fv 1 ; . . . ; v m ; wg is linearly dependent. No v k can be a linear combination of preceding vectors.

144

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
Hence, w is a linear combination of the v i . Thus, w 2 spanðv i Þ, and hence S  spanðv i Þ. This leads to
V ¼ spanðSÞ  spanðv i Þ  V
Thus, fv i g spans V, and, as it is linearly independent, it is a basis of V.

(ii)

The remaining vectors form a maximum linearly independent subset of S; hence, by (i), it is a basis
of V.

4.39. Prove Theorem 4.16: Let V be a vector space of ﬁnite dimension and let S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur g be a
set of linearly independent vectors in V. Then S is part of a basis of V ; that is, S may be extended
to a basis of V.
Suppose B ¼ fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn g is a basis of V. Then B spans V, and hence V is spanned by
S [ B ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur ; w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn g
By Theorem 4.15, we can delete from S [ B each vector that is a linear combination of preceding vectors to
obtain a basis B0 for V. Because S is linearly independent, no uk is a linear combination of preceding vectors.
Thus, B0 contains every vector in S, and S is part of the basis B0 for V.

4.40. Prove Theorem 4.17: Let W be a subspace of an n-dimensional vector space V. Then dim W  n.
In particular, if dim W ¼ n, then W ¼ V.
Because V is of dimension n, any n þ 1 or more vectors are linearly dependent. Furthermore, because a
basis of W consists of linearly independent vectors, it cannot contain more than n elements. Accordingly,
dim W  n.
In particular, if fw1 ; . . . ; wn g is a basis of W, then, because it is an independent set with n elements, it is
also a basis of V. Thus, W ¼ V when dim W ¼ n.

Observe that this simultaneously reduces all the matrices Mk to echelon form; for example, the ﬁrst four
columns of the echelon form of A are an echelon form of M4 . We know that rankðMk Þ is equal to the
number of pivots or, equivalently, the number of nonzero rows in an echelon form of Mk . Thus,
rankðM3 Þ ¼ rankðM4 Þ ¼ 2
rankðM1 Þ ¼ rankðM2 Þ ¼ 1;
rankðM5 Þ ¼ rankðM6 Þ ¼ 3
The vector equation x1 C1 þ x2 C2 þ    þ xk Ck ¼ Ckþ1 yields the system with coefﬁcient matrix Mk
and augmented Mkþ1 . Thus, Ckþ1 is a linear combination of C1 ; . . . ; Ck if and only if
rankðMk Þ ¼ rankðMkþ1 Þ or, equivalently, if Ckþ1 does not contain a pivot. Thus, each of C2 , C4 , C6
is a linear combination of preceding columns.
(c) In the echelon form of A, the pivots are in the ﬁrst, third, and ﬁfth columns. Thus, columns C1 , C3 , C5
of A form a basis for the columns space of A. Alternatively, deleting columns C2 , C4 , C6 from the
spanning set of columns (they are linear combinations of other columns), we obtain, again, C1 , C3 , C5 .
(d) The echelon matrix tells us that C4 is a linear combination of columns C1 and C3 . The augmented
matrix M of the vector equation C4 ¼ xC1 þ yC2 consists of the columns C1 , C3 , C4 of A which, when
reduced to echelon form, yields the matrix (omitting zero rows)

where b1i ; b2i ; . . . ; bmi are the entries in the ith column of B.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
We are given that u ¼ k1 R1 þ k2 R2 þ    þ km Rm . Hence,
ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ ¼ k1 ðb11 ; . . . ; b1n Þ þ    þ km ðbm1 ; . . . ; bmn Þ
¼ ðk1 b11 þ    þ km bm1 ; . . . ; k1 b1n þ    þ km bmn Þ

Setting corresponding components equal to each other, we obtain the desired result.

4.45. Prove Theorem 4.7: Suppose A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  are row equivalent echelon matrices with
respective pivot entries
a1j1 ; a2j2 ; . . . ; arjr

and

b1k1 ; b2k2 ; . . . ; bsks

(pictured in Fig. 4-5). Then A and B have the same number of nonzero rows—that is, r ¼ s—and
their pivot entries are in the same positions; that is, j1 ¼ k1 ; j2 ¼ k2 ; . . . ; jr ¼ kr .

Clearly A ¼ 0 if and only if B ¼ 0, and so we need only prove the theorem when r  1 and s  1. We
ﬁrst show that j1 ¼ k1 . Suppose j1 < k1 . Then the j1 th column of B is zero. Because the ﬁrst row R* of A is in
the row space of B, we have R* ¼ c1 R1 þ c1 R2 þ    þ cm Rm , where the Ri are the rows of B. Because the
j1 th column of B is zero, we have
a1j1 ¼ c1 0 þ c2 0 þ    þ cm 0 ¼ 0
But this contradicts the fact that the pivot entry a1j1 6¼ 0. Hence, j1  k1 and, similarly, k1  j1 . Thus j1 ¼ k1 .
Now let A0 be the submatrix of A obtained by deleting the ﬁrst row of A, and let B0 be the submatrix of B
obtained by deleting the ﬁrst row of B. We prove that A0 and B0 have the same row space. The theorem will
then follow by induction, because A0 and B0 are also echelon matrices.
Let R ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ be any row of A0 and let R1 ; . . . ; Rm be the rows of B. Because R is in the row
space of B, there exist scalars d1 ; . . . ; dm such that R ¼ d1 R1 þ d2 R2 þ    þ dm Rm . Because A is in echelon
form and R is not the ﬁrst row of A, the j1 th entry of R is zero: ai ¼ 0 for i ¼ j1 ¼ k1 . Furthermore, because B is
6 0, but
in echelon form, all the entries in the k1 th column of B are 0 except the ﬁrst: b1k1 ¼
b2k1 ¼ 0; . . . ; bmk1 ¼ 0. Thus,
0 ¼ ak1 ¼ d1 b1k1 þ d2 0 þ    þ dm 0 ¼ d1 b1k1
Now b1k1 6¼ 0 and so d1 ¼ 0. Thus, R is a linear combination of R2 ; . . . ; Rm and so is in the row space of B0 .
Because R was any row of A0 , the row space of A0 is contained in the row space of B0 . Similarly, the row
space of B0 is contained in the row space of A0 . Thus, A0 and B0 have the same row space, and so the theorem
is proved.

4.46. Prove Theorem 4.8: Suppose A and B are row canonical matrices. Then A and B have the same
row space if and only if they have the same nonzero rows.
Obviously, if A and B have the same nonzero rows, then they have the same row space. Thus we only
have to prove the converse.
Suppose A and B have the same row space, and suppose R 6¼ 0 is the ith row of A. Then there exist
scalars c1 ; . . . ; cs such that
R ¼ c1 R1 þ c2 R2 þ    þ cs Rs

ð1Þ

where the Ri are the nonzero rows of B. The theorem is proved if we show that R ¼ Ri ; that is, that ci ¼ 1 but
ck ¼ 0 for k 6¼ i.

147

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Let aij , be the pivot entry in R—that is, the ﬁrst nonzero entry of R. By (1) and Problem 4.44,
aiji ¼ c1 b1ji þ c2 b2ji þ    þ cs bsji

ð2Þ

But, by Problem 4.45, biji is a pivot entry of B, and, as B is row reduced, it is the only nonzero entry in the jth
column of B. Thus, from (2), we obtain aiji ¼ ci biji . However, aiji ¼ 1 and biji ¼ 1, because A and B are row
reduced; hence, ci ¼ 1.
Now suppose k 6¼ i, and bkjk is the pivot entry in Rk . By (1) and Problem 4.44,
aijk ¼ c1 b1jk þ c2 b2jk þ    þ cs bsjk

ð3Þ

Because B is row reduced, bkjk is the only nonzero entry in the jth column of B. Hence, by (3), aijk ¼ ck bkjk .
Furthermore, by Problem 4.45, akjk is a pivot entry of A, and because A is row reduced, aijk ¼ 0. Thus,
ck bkjk ¼ 0, and as bkjk ¼ 1, ck ¼ 0. Accordingly R ¼ Ri ; and the theorem is proved.

4.47. Prove Corollary 4.9: Every matrix A is row equivalent to a unique matrix in row canonical
form.
Suppose A is row equivalent to matrices A1 and A2 , where A1 and A2 are in row canonical form. Then
rowspðAÞ ¼ rowspðA1 Þ and rowspðAÞ ¼ rowspðA2 Þ. Hence, rowspðA1 Þ ¼ rowspðA2 Þ. Because A1 and A2 are
in row canonical form, A1 ¼ A2 by Theorem 4.8. Thus, the corollary is proved.

4.48. Suppose RB and AB are deﬁned, where R is a row vector and A and B are matrices. Prove
(a)

RB is a linear combination of the rows of B.

(b)

The row space of AB is contained in the row space of B.

(c)

The column space of AB is contained in the column space of A.

(d)

If C is a column vector and AC is deﬁned, then AC is a linear combination of the columns
of A:

(e)

rankðABÞ  rankðBÞ and rankðABÞ  rankðAÞ.

(a)

Suppose R ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; am Þ and B ¼ ½bij . Let B1 ; . . . ; Bm denote the rows of B and B1 ; . . . ; Bn its
columns. Then
RB ¼ ðRB1 ; RB2 ; . . . ; RBn Þ
¼ ða1 b11 þ a2 b21 þ    þ am bm1 ; . . . ; a1 b1n þ a2 b2n þ    þ am bmn Þ
¼ a1 ðb11 ; b12 ; . . . ; b1n Þ þ a2 ðb21 ; b22 ; . . . ; b2n Þ þ    þ am ðbm1 ; bm2 ; . . . ; bmn Þ
¼ a1 B1 þ a2 B2 þ    þ am Bm

(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

Thus, RB is a linear combination of the rows of B, as claimed.
The rows of AB are Ri B, where Ri is the ith row of A. Thus, by part (a), each row of AB is in the row
space of B. Thus, rowspðABÞ  rowspðBÞ, as claimed.
Using part (b), we have colspðABÞ ¼ rowspðABÞT ¼ rowspðBT AT Þ  rowspðAT Þ ¼ colspðAÞ:
Follows from ðcÞ where C replaces B:
The row space of AB is contained in the row space of B; hence, rankðABÞ  rankðBÞ. Furthermore, the
column space of AB is contained in the column space of A; hence, rankðABÞ  rankðAÞ.

4.49. Let A be an n-square matrix. Show that A is invertible if and only if rankðAÞ ¼ n.
Note that the rows of the n-square identity matrix In are linearly independent, because In is in echelon
form; hence, rankðIn Þ ¼ n. Now if A is invertible, then A is row equivalent to In ; hence, rankðAÞ ¼ n. But if
A is not invertible, then A is row equivalent to a matrix with a zero row; hence, rankðAÞ < n; that is, A is
invertible if and only if rankðAÞ ¼ n.

4.50. Find the dimension and a basis of the solution space W of each homogeneous system:

x þ 2y þ z  2t ¼ 0

(b)

x þ y þ 2z ¼ 0
2x þ 3y þ 3z ¼ 0
x þ 3y þ 5z ¼ 0
(c)

Reduce the system to echelon form:
x þ 2y þ 2z  s þ 3t ¼ 0
z þ 2s  2t ¼ 0
2z þ 4s  4t ¼ 0

or

x þ 2y þ 2z  s þ 3t ¼ 0
z þ 2s  2t ¼ 0

The system in echelon form has two (nonzero) equations in ﬁve unknowns. Hence, the system has
5  2 ¼ 3 free variables, which are y, s, t. Thus, dim W ¼ 3. We obtain a basis for W:
ð1Þ Set y ¼ 1; s ¼ 0; t ¼ 0

to obtain the solution

v 1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ:

ð2Þ Set y ¼ 0; s ¼ 1; t ¼ 0
ð3Þ Set y ¼ 0; s ¼ 0; t ¼ 1

to obtain the solution

v 2 ¼ ð5; 0; 2; 1; 0Þ:
v 3 ¼ ð7; 0; 2; 0; 1Þ:

The set fv 1 ; v 2 ; v 3 g is a basis of the solution space W.

This corresponds to the system

The free variables are y and t, and dim W ¼ 2.
(i) Set y ¼ 1, z ¼ 0 to obtain the solution u1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0Þ.
(ii) Set y ¼ 0, z ¼ 2 to obtain the solution u2 ¼ ð6; 0; 1; 2Þ.
Then fu1 ; u2 g is a basis of W.

This corresponds to a triangular system with no free variables. Thus, 0 is the only solution; that is,
W ¼ f0g. Hence, dim W ¼ 0.

Let v ¼ ðx; y; z; tÞ. Then v 2 W if and only if v is a linear combination of the vectors u1 , u2 , u3 that span

reduce M to echelon form. This yields

Then v is a linear combination of u1 , u2 , u3 if rankðMÞ ¼ rankðAÞ, where A is the submatrix without column

Let A be the matrix whose rows are the v i . We interchange column 1 and column i1 , then column 2 and

The above matrix B is in echelon form, and so its rows are independent; hence, rankðBÞ ¼ k. Because A and
B are column equivalent, they have the same rank—rankðAÞ ¼ k. But A has k rows; hence, these rows (i.e.,
the v i ) are linearly independent, as claimed.

Sums, Direct Sums, Intersections
4.53. Let U and W be subspaces of a vector space V. Show that
(a)

U þ V is a subspace of V.

(b)

U and W are contained in U þ W.

(c)

U þ W is the smallest subspace containing U and W; that is, U þ W ¼ spanðU ; W Þ.

(d)

W þ W ¼ W.

(a)

Because U and W are subspaces, 0 2 U and 0 2 W. Hence, 0 ¼ 0 þ 0 belongs to U þ W. Now suppose
v; v 0 2 U þ W. Then v ¼ u þ w and v 0 ¼ u0 þ v 0 , where u; u0 2 U and w; w0 2 W. Then
av þ bv 0 ¼ ðau þ bu0 Þ þ ðaw þ bw0 Þ 2 U þ W

Thus, U þ W is a subspace of V.
Let u 2 U . Because W is a subspace, 0 2 W. Hence, u ¼ u þ 0 belongs to U þ W. Thus, U  U þ W.
Similarly, W  U þ W.
(c) Because U þ W is a subspace of V containing U and W, it must also contain the linear span of U and
W. That is, spanðU ; W Þ  U þ W.
On the other hand, if v 2 U þ W, then v ¼ u þ w ¼ 1u þ 1w, where u 2 U and w 2 W. Thus, v is
a linear combination of elements in U [ W, and so v 2 spanðU ; W Þ. Hence, U þ W  spanðU ; W Þ.
The two inclusion relations give the desired result.
(d) Because W is a subspace of V, we have that W is closed under vector addition; hence, W þ W  W. By
part (a), W  W þ W. Hence, W þ W ¼ W.

Thus, dimðU þ W Þ ¼ 3.

2x  y þ t ¼ 0

Combine both of the above systems to obtain a homogeneous system, whose solution space is U \ W, and
reduce the system to echelon form, yielding
x þ y þ z ¼ 0
2y þ 4z þ s ¼ 0
8z þ 5s þ 2t ¼ 0

There is one free variable, which is t; hence, dimðU \ W Þ ¼ 1. Setting t ¼ 2, we obtain the solution
u ¼ ð1; 4; 3; 4; 2Þ, which forms our required basis of U \ W.

4.55. Suppose U and W are distinct four-dimensional subspaces of a vector space V, where dim V ¼ 6.
Find the possible dimensions of U \ W.
Because U and W are distinct, U þ W properly contains U and W ; consequently, dimðU þ W Þ > 4.
But dimðU þ W Þ cannot be greater than 6, as dim V ¼ 6. Hence, we have two possibilities: (a)
dimðU þ W Þ ¼ 5 or (b) dimðU þ W Þ ¼ 6. By Theorem 4.20,
dimðU \ W Þ ¼ dim U þ dim W  dimðU þ W Þ ¼ 8  dimðU þ W Þ
Thus (a) dimðU \ W Þ ¼ 3 or (b) dimðU \ W Þ ¼ 2.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
4.56. Let U and W be the following subspaces of R3 :
U ¼ fða; b; cÞ : a ¼ b ¼ cg

and

W ¼ fð0; b; cÞg

(Note that W is the yz-plane.) Show that R3 ¼ U

First we show that U \ W ¼ f0g. Suppose v ¼ ða; b; cÞ 2 U \ W. Then a ¼ b ¼ c and a ¼ 0. Hence,
a ¼ 0, b ¼ 0, c ¼ 0. Thus, v ¼ 0 ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ.
Next we show that R3 ¼ U þ W. For, if v ¼ ða; b; cÞ 2 R3 , then
v ¼ ða; a; aÞ þ ð0; b  a; c  aÞ
where
ða; a; aÞ 2 U and ð0; b  a; c  aÞ 2 W
3
Both conditions U \ W ¼ f0g and U þ W ¼ R imply that R3 ¼ U W.

4.57. Suppose that U and W are subspaces of a vector space V and that S ¼ fui g spans U and S 0 ¼ fwj g
spans W. Show that S [ S 0 spans U þ W. (Accordingly, by induction, if Si spans Wi , for
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, then S1 [ . . . [ Sn spans W1 þ    þ Wn .)
Let v 2 U þ W. Then v ¼ u þ w, where u 2 U and w 2 W. Because S spans U , u is a linear
combination of ui , and as S 0 spans W, w is a linear combination of wj ; say
u ¼ a1 ui1 þ a2 ui2 þ    þ ar uir

and

v ¼ b1 wj1 þ b2 wj2 þ    þ bs wjs

where ai ; bj 2 K. Then
v ¼ u þ w ¼ a1 ui1 þ a2 ui2 þ    þ ar uir þ b1 wj1 þ b2 wj2 þ    þ bs wjs
Accordingly, S [ S 0 ¼ fui ; wj g spans U þ W.

4.58. Prove Theorem 4.20: Suppose U and V are ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of a vector space V. Then
U þ W has ﬁnite dimension and
dimðU þ W Þ ¼ dim U þ dim W  dimðU \ W Þ
Observe that U \ W is a subspace of both U and W. Suppose dim U ¼ m, dim W ¼ n,
dimðU \ W Þ ¼ r. Suppose fv 1 ; . . . ; v r g is a basis of U \ W. By Theorem 4.16, we can extend fv i g to a
basis of U and to a basis of W ; say
fv 1 ; . . . ; v r ; u1 ; . . . ; umr g
are bases of U and W, respectively. Let

and

fv 1 ; . . . ; v r ; w1 ; . . . ; wnr g

B ¼ fv 1 ; . . . ; v r ; u1 ; . . . ; umr ; w1 ; . . . ; wnr g
Note that B has exactly m þ n  r elements. Thus, the theorem is proved if we can show that B is a basis
of U þ W. Because fv i ; uj g spans U and fv i ; wk g spans W, the union B ¼ fv i ; uj ; wk g spans U þ W. Thus, it
sufﬁces to show that B is independent.
Suppose
a1 v 1 þ    þ ar v r þ b1 u1 þ    þ bmr umr þ c1 w1 þ    þ cnr wnr ¼ 0

ð1Þ

where ai , bj , ck are scalars. Let
v ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ ar v r þ b1 u1 þ    þ bmr umr

ð2Þ

By (1), we also have
v ¼ c1 w1      cnr wnr
ð3Þ
Because fv i ; uj g  U , v 2 U by (2); and as fwk g  W, v 2 W by (3). Accordingly, v 2 U \ W. Now fv i g is
a basis of U \ W, and so there exist scalars d1 ; . . . ; dr for which v ¼ d1 v 1 þ    þ dr v r . Thus, by (3), we have
d1 v 1 þ    þ dr v r þ c1 w1 þ    þ cnr wnr ¼ 0
But fv i ; wk g is a basis of W, and so is independent. Hence, the above equation forces c1 ¼ 0; . . . ; cnr ¼ 0.
Substituting this into (1), we obtain
a1 v 1 þ    þ ar v r þ b1 u1 þ    þ bmr umr ¼ 0
But fv i ; uj g is a basis of U , and so is independent. Hence, the above equation forces a1 ¼
0; . . . ; ar ¼ 0; b1 ¼ 0; . . . ; bmr ¼ 0.
Because (1) implies that the ai , bj , ck are all 0, B ¼ fv i ; uj ; wk g is independent, and the theorem is
proved.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

4.59. Prove Theorem 4.21: V ¼ U

W if and only if (i) V ¼ U þ W, (ii) U \ W ¼ f0g.

Suppose V ¼ U W. Then any v 2 V can be uniquely written in the form v ¼ u þ w, where u 2 U and
w 2 W. Thus, in particular, V ¼ U þ W. Now suppose v 2 U \ W. Then
ð1Þ v ¼ v þ 0; where v 2 U ; 0 2 W ; ð2Þ v ¼ 0 þ v; where 0 2 U ; v 2 W :
Thus, v ¼ 0 þ 0 ¼ 0 and U \ W ¼ f0g.
On the other hand, suppose V ¼ U þ W and U \ W ¼ f0g. Let v 2 V. Because V ¼ U þ W, there exist
u 2 U and w 2 W such that v ¼ u þ w. We need to show that such a sum is unique. Suppose also that
v ¼ u0 þ w0 , where u0 2 U and w0 2 W. Then
and so
u þ w ¼ u0 þ w0 ;
But u  u 2 U and w  w 2 W ; hence, by U \ W ¼ f0g,

u  u0 ¼ w0  w

u  u0 ¼ 0;

u ¼ u0 ;

0

0

w0  w ¼ 0;

Thus, such a sum for v 2 V is unique, and V ¼ U

and so

w ¼ w0

W.

4.60. Prove Theorem 4.22 (for two factors): Suppose V ¼ U W. Also, suppose S ¼ fu1 ; . . . ; um g and
S 0 ¼ fw1 ; . . . ; wn g are linearly independent subsets of U and W, respectively. Then
(a)

The union S [ S 0 is linearly independent in V.

(b)

If S and S 0 are bases of U and W, respectively, then S [ S 0 is a basis of V.

(c)

dim V ¼ dim U þ dim W.

(a)

Suppose a1 u1 þ    þ am um þ b1 w1 þ    þ bn wn ¼ 0, where ai , bj are scalars. Then
ða1 u1 þ    þ am um Þ þ ðb1 w1 þ    þ bn wn Þ ¼ 0 ¼ 0 þ 0
where 0; a1 u1 þ    þ am um 2 U and 0; b1 w1 þ    þ bn wn 2 W. Because such a sum for 0 is unique,
this leads to
a1 u1 þ    þ am um ¼ 0

and

b1 w1 þ    þ bn wn ¼ 0

Because S1 is linearly independent, each ai ¼ 0, and because S2 is linearly independent, each bj ¼ 0.
Thus, S ¼ S1 [ S2 is linearly independent.
(b) By part (a), S ¼ S1 [ S2 is linearly independent, and, by Problem 4.55, S ¼ S1 [ S2 spans V ¼ U þ W.
Thus, S ¼ S1 [ S2 is a basis of V.
(c) This follows directly from part (b).

Coordinates
4.61. Relative to the basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 g ¼ fð1; 1Þ; ð2; 3Þg of R2 , ﬁnd the coordinate vector of v, where
(a) v ¼ ð4; 3Þ, (b) v ¼ ða; bÞ.
In each case, set
v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 ¼ xð1; 1Þ þ yð2; 3Þ ¼ ðx þ 2y; x þ 3yÞ
and then solve for x and y.
(a) We have
ð4; 3Þ ¼ ðx þ 2y; x þ 3yÞ

(b)

or

x þ 2y ¼ 4
x þ 3y ¼ 3

or

x þ 2y ¼ a
x þ 3y ¼ b

The solution is x ¼ 18, y ¼ 7. Hence, ½v ¼ ½18; 7.
We have
ða; bÞ ¼ ðx þ 2y; x þ 3yÞ

The solution is x ¼ 3a  2b, y ¼ a þ b. Hence, ½v ¼ ½3a  2b;

a þ b.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
4.62. Find the coordinate vector of v ¼ ða; b; cÞ in R3 relative to

the usual basis E ¼ fð1; 0; 0Þ; ð0; 1; 0Þ; ð0; 0; 1Þg,

(b)

the basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; u3 g ¼ fð1; 1; 1Þ; ð1; 1; 0Þ; ð1; 0; 0Þg.

(a) Relative to the usual basis E, the coordinates of ½vE are the same as v. That is, ½vE ¼ ½a; b; c.
(b) Set v as a linear combination of u1 , u2 , u3 using unknown scalars x, y, z. This yields

4.63. Consider the vector space P3 ðtÞ of polynomials of degree  3.
(a)

Show that S ¼ fðt  1Þ3 ; ðt  1Þ2 ; t  1; 1g is a basis of P3 ðtÞ.

(b)

Find the coordinate vector ½v of v ¼ 3t3  4t2 þ 2t  5 relative to S.

The degree of ðt  1Þk is k; writing the polynomials of S in reverse order, we see that no polynomial is
a linear combination of preceding polynomials. Thus, the polynomials are linearly independent, and,
because dim P3 ðtÞ ¼ 4, they form a basis of P3 ðtÞ.
(b) Set v as a linear combination of the basis vectors using unknown scalars x, y, z, s. We have

(a)

v ¼ 3t3 þ 4t2 þ 2t  5 ¼ xðt  1Þ3 þ yðt  1Þ2 þ zðt  1Þ þ sð1Þ

Then set coefﬁcients of the same powers of t equal to each other to obtain
x ¼ 3;

3x þ y ¼ 4;

3x  2y þ z ¼ 2;

x þ y  z þ s ¼ 5

Solving the system yields x ¼ 3, y ¼ 13, z ¼ 19, s ¼ 4. Thus, ½v ¼ ½3; 13; 19; 4.

the coordinate vector of A is a vector in R4 , because dim M ¼ 4.)

written row by row.

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
Remark: This result is true in general; that is, if A is any m n matrix in M ¼ Mm;n , then the
coordinates of A relative to the usual basis of M are the elements of A written row by row.

4 0 5
If the matrices are linearly dependent, ﬁnd the dimension and a basis of the subspace W of M
spanned by the matrices.
The coordinate vectors of the above matrices relative to the usual basis of M are as follows:
½A ¼ ½1; 2; 3; 4; 0; 5;
½B ¼ ½2; 4; 7; 10; 1; 13;
½C ¼ ½1; 2; 5; 8; 2; 11
Form the matrix M whose rows are the above coordinate vectors, and reduce M to echelon form:
3

1 2 3 4 0 5

1 2 5

Because the echelon matrix has only two nonzero rows, the coordinate vectors ½A, ½B, ½C span a space of
dimension two, and so they are linearly dependent. Thus, A, B, C are linearly dependent. Furthermore,
dim W ¼ 2, and the matrices

Miscellaneous Problems
4.66. Consider a ﬁnite sequence of vectors S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g. Let T be the sequence of vectors
obtained from S by one of the following ‘‘elementary operations’’: (i) interchange two vectors,
(ii) multiply a vector by a nonzero scalar, (iii) add a multiple of one vector to another. Show that S
and T span the same space W. Also show that T is independent if and only if S is independent.
Observe that, for each operation, the vectors in T are linear combinations of vectors in S. On the other
hand, each operation has an inverse of the same type (Prove!); hence, the vectors in S are linear combinations
of vectors in T . Thus S and T span the same space W. Also, T is independent if and only if dim W ¼ n, and this
is true if and only if S is also independent.

4.67. Let A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  be row equivalent m
any vectors in a vector space V over K. Let
u1 ¼ a11 v 1 þ a12 v 2 þ    þ a1n v n
u2 ¼ a21 v 1 þ a22 v 2 þ    þ a2n v n

um ¼ am1 v 1 þ am2 v 2 þ    þ amn v n

n matrices over a ﬁeld K, and let v 1 ; . . . ; v n be

w2 ¼ b21 v 1 þ b22 v 2 þ    þ b2n v n
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
wm ¼ bm1 v 1 þ bm2 v 2 þ    þ bmn v n

Show that fui g and fwi g span the same space.
Applying an ‘‘elementary operation’’ of Problem 4.66 to fui g is equivalent to applying an elementary
row operation to the matrix A. Because A and B are row equivalent, B can be obtained from A by a sequence
of elementary row operations; hence, fwi g can be obtained from fui g by the corresponding sequence of
operations. Accordingly, fui g and fwi g span the same space.

4.68. Let v 1 ; . . . ; v n belong to a vector space V over K, and let P ¼ ½aij  be an n-square matrix over K. Let
...;
wn ¼ an1 v 1 þ an2 v 2 þ    þ ann v n
w1 ¼ a11 v 1 þ a12 v 2 þ    þ a1n v n ;
(a)

Suppose P is invertible. Show that fwi g and fv i g span the same space; hence, fwi g is
independent if and only if fv i g is independent.

(b)

Suppose P is not invertible. Show that fwi g is dependent.

(c)

Suppose fwi g is independent. Show that P is invertible.

155

CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces

Because P is invertible, it is row equivalent to the identity matrix I. Hence, by Problem 4.67, fwi g and
fv i g span the same space. Thus, one is independent if and only if the other is.
(b) Because P is not invertible, it is row equivalent to a matrix with a zero row. This means that fwi g spans
a space that has a spanning set of less than n elements. Thus, fwi g is dependent.
(c) This is the contrapositive of the statement of (b), and so it follows from (b).

(a)

4.69. Suppose that A1 ; A2 ; . . . are linearly independent sets of vectors, and that A1  A2  . . .. Show
that the union A ¼ A1 [ A2 [ . . . is also linearly independent.
Suppose A is linearly dependent. Then there exist vectors v 1 ; . . . ; v n 2 A and scalars a1 ; . . . ; an 2 K, not
all of them 0, such that
a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n ¼ 0

Because A ¼ [ Ai and the v i 2 A, there exist sets Ai1 ; . . . ; Ain such that
v 1 2 Ai1 ;

v 2 2 Ai2 ;

Let k be the maximum index of the sets Aij : k ¼ maxði1 ; . . . ; in Þ. It follows then, as A1  A2  . . . ; that
each Aij is contained in Ak . Hence, v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n 2 Ak , and so, by (1), Ak is linearly dependent, which
contradicts our hypothesis. Thus, A is linearly independent.

4.70. Let K be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld L, and let L be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld E. (Thus, K  L  E, and K is a
subﬁeld of E.) Suppose E is of dimension n over L, and L is of dimension m over K. Show that E is
of dimension mn over K.
Suppose fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g is a basis of E over L and fa1 ; . . . ; am g is a basis of L over K. We claim that
fai v j : i ¼ 1; . . . ; m; j ¼ 1; . . . ; ng is a basis of E over K. Note that fai v j g contains mn elements.
Let w be any arbitrary element in E. Because fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g spans E over L, w is a linear combination of
the v i with coefﬁcients in L:
w ¼ b1 v 1 þ b2 v 2 þ    þ bn v n ;

Because fa1 ; . . . ; am g spans L over K, each bi 2 L is a linear combination of the aj with coefﬁcients in K:

where kji 2 K. Thus, w is a linear combination of the ai v j with coefﬁcients in K; hence, fai v j g spans E over

The proof is P
complete if we show that fai v j g is linearly independent over K. Suppose, for scalars
xji 2 K; we have
i;j xji ðai v j Þ ¼ 0; that is,
ðx11 a1 v 1 þ x12 a2 v 1 þ    þ x1m am v 1 Þ þ    þ ðxn1 a1 v n þ xn2 a2 v n þ    þ xnm am v m Þ ¼ 0

Because fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g is linearly independent over L and the above coefﬁcients of the v i belong to L, each
coefﬁcient must be 0:
x11 a1 þ x12 a2 þ    þ x1m am ¼ 0;

xn1 a1 þ xn2 a2 þ    þ xnm am ¼ 0

But fa1 ; . . . ; am g is linearly independent over K; hence, because the xji 2 K,
x11 ¼ 0; x12 ¼ 0; . . . ; x1m ¼ 0; . . . ; xn1 ¼ 0; xn2 ¼ 0; . . . ; xnm ¼ 0
Accordingly, fai v j g is linearly independent over K, and the theorem is proved.

Linear Mappings
5.1

Introduction

The main subject matter of linear algebra is the study of linear mappings and their representation by
means of matrices. This chapter introduces us to these linear maps and Chapter 6 shows how they can be
represented by matrices. First, however, we begin with a study of mappings in general.

5.2

Mappings, Functions

Let A and B be arbitrary nonempty sets. Suppose to each element in a 2 A there is assigned a unique
element of B; called the image of a. The collection f of such assignments is called a mapping (or map)
from A into B, and it is denoted by
f :A!B
The set A is called the domain of the mapping, and B is called the target set. We write f ðaÞ, read ‘‘f of a;’’
for the unique element of B that f assigns to a 2 A.
One may also view a mapping f : A ! B as a computer that, for each input value a 2 A, produces a
unique output f ðaÞ 2 B.
Remark: The term function is used synonymously with the word mapping, although some texts
reserve the word ‘‘function’’ for a real-valued or complex-valued mapping.
Consider a mapping f : A ! B. If A0 is any subset of A, then f ðA0 Þ denotes the set of images of
elements of A0 ; and if B0 is any subset of B, then f 1 ðB0 Þ denotes the set of elements of A; each of whose
image lies in B. That is,
f ðA0 Þ ¼ f f ðaÞ : a 2 A0 g
and
f 1 ðB0 Þ ¼ fa 2 A : f ðaÞ 2 B0 g
We call f ðA0 ) the image of A0 and f 1 ðB0 Þ the inverse image or preimage of B0 . In particular, the set of all
images (i.e., f ðAÞ) is called the image or range of f.
To each mapping f : A ! B there corresponds the subset of A B given by fða; f ðaÞÞ : a 2 Ag. We
call this set the graph of f . Two mappings f : A ! B and g : A ! B are deﬁned to be equal, written
f ¼ g, if f ðaÞ ¼ gðaÞ for every a 2 A—that is, if they have the same graph. Thus, we do not distinguish
between a function and its graph. The negation of f ¼ g is written f 6¼ g and is the statement:
There exists an a 2 A for which f ðaÞ 6¼ gðaÞ:
Sometimes the ‘‘barred’’ arrow 7! is used to denote the image of an arbitrary element x 2 A under a
mapping f : A ! B by writing
x 7! f ðxÞ
This is illustrated in the following example.

164

165

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings
EXAMPLE 5.1

(a) Let f : R ! R be the function that assigns to each real number x its square x2 . We can denote this function by
writing

f ðxÞ ¼ x2

x 7! x2

or

Here the image of 3 is 9, so we may write f ð3Þ ¼ 9. However, f 1 ð9Þ ¼ f3; 3g. Also,
f ðRÞ ¼ ½0; 1Þ ¼ fx : x  0g is the image of f.
(b) Let A ¼ fa; b; c; dg and B ¼ fx; y; z; tg. Then the following deﬁnes a mapping f : A ! B:

f ðaÞ ¼ y; f ðbÞ ¼ x; f ðcÞ ¼ z; f ðdÞ ¼ y

or

f ¼ fða; yÞ; ðb; xÞ; ðc; zÞ; ðd; yÞg

The ﬁrst deﬁnes the mapping explicitly, and the second deﬁnes the mapping by its graph. Here,

f ðfa; b; dgÞ ¼ f f ðaÞ; f ðbÞ; f ðdÞg ¼ fy; x; yg ¼ fx; yg
Furthermore, f ðAÞ ¼ fx; y; zg is the image of f.
Let V be the vector space of polynomials over R, and let pðtÞ ¼ 3t2  5t þ 2.

EXAMPLE 5.2

(a) The derivative deﬁnes a mapping D : V ! V where, for any polynomials f ðtÞ, we have Dð f Þ ¼ df =dt. Thus,

DðpÞ ¼ Dð3t2  5t þ 2Þ ¼ 6t  5
(b) The integral, say from 0 to 1, deﬁnes a mapping J : V ! R. That is, for any polynomial f ðtÞ,

ð1
Jð f Þ ¼

ð1
f ðtÞ dt;

JðpÞ ¼

and so

0

0

ð3t2  5t þ 2Þ ¼ 12

Observe that the mapping in (b) is from the vector space V into the scalar ﬁeld R, whereas the mapping in (a) is from
the vector space V into itself.

Matrix Mappings
Let A be any m

n matrix over K. Then A determines a mapping FA : K n ! K m by

FA ðuÞ ¼ Au
where the vectors in K n and K m are written as columns. For example, suppose
2

and
u ¼ 4 35

Remark: For notational convenience, we will frequently denote the mapping FA by the letter A, the
same symbol as used for the matrix.

Composition of Mappings
Consider two mappings f : A ! B and g : B ! C, illustrated below:
f

g

A ! B ! C
The composition of f and g, denoted by g  f , is the mapping g  f : A ! C deﬁned by
ðg  f ÞðaÞ  gð f ðaÞÞ

166

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

That is, ﬁrst we apply f to a 2 A, and then we apply g to f ðaÞ 2 B to get gð f ðaÞÞ 2 C. Viewing f and g
as ‘‘computers,’’ the composition means we ﬁrst input a 2 A to get the output f ðaÞ 2 B using f , and then
we input f ðaÞ to get the output gð f ðaÞÞ 2 C using g.
Our ﬁrst theorem tells us that the composition of mappings satisﬁes the associative law.
Let f : A ! B, g : B ! C, h : C ! D. Then

THEOREM 5.1:

h  ðg  f Þ ¼ ðh  gÞ  f
We prove this theorem here. Let a 2 A. Then
ðh  ðg  f ÞÞðaÞ ¼ hððg  f ÞðaÞÞ ¼ hðgð f ðaÞÞÞ
ððh  gÞ  f ÞðaÞ ¼ ðh  gÞð f ðaÞÞ ¼ hðgð f ðaÞÞÞ
Thus, ðh  ðg  f ÞÞðaÞ ¼ ððh  gÞ  f ÞðaÞ for every a 2 A, and so h  ðg  f Þ ¼ ðh  gÞ  f.

One-to-One and Onto Mappings
We formally introduce some special types of mappings.
A mapping f : A ! B is said to be one-to-one (or 1-1 or injective) if different elements
of A have distinct images; that is,

DEFINITION:

If f ðaÞ ¼ f ða0 Þ; then a ¼ a0 :
DEFINITION:

A mapping f : A ! B is said to be onto (or f maps A onto B or surjective) if every b 2 B
is the image of at least one a 2 A.

DEFINITION:

A mapping f : A ! B is said to be a one-to-one correspondence between A and B (or
bijective) if f is both one-to-one and onto.

EXAMPLE 5.3

Let f : R ! R, g : R ! R, h : R ! R be deﬁned by

f ðxÞ ¼ 2x ;

gðxÞ ¼ x3  x;

hðxÞ ¼ x2

The graphs of these functions are shown in Fig. 5-1. The function f is one-to-one. Geometrically, this means
that each horizontal line does not contain more than one point of f. The function g is onto. Geometrically,
this means that each horizontal line contains at least one point of g. The function h is neither one-to-one nor
onto. For example, both 2 and 2 have the same image 4, and 16 has no preimage.

Figure 5-1

Identity and Inverse Mappings
Let A be any nonempty set. The mapping f : A ! A deﬁned by f ðaÞ ¼ a—that is, the function that
assigns to each element in A itself—is called identity mapping. It is usually denoted by 1A or 1 or I. Thus,
for any a 2 A, we have 1A ðaÞ ¼ a.

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

167

Now let f : A ! B. We call g : B ! A the inverse of f, written f 1 , if
f  g ¼ 1B

and

g  f ¼ 1A

We emphasize that f has an inverse if and only if f is a one-to-one correspondence between A and B; that
is, f is one-to-one and onto (Problem 5.7). Also, if b 2 B, then f 1 ðbÞ ¼ a, where a is the unique element
of A for which f ðaÞ ¼ b

5.3

Linear Mappings (Linear Transformations)

We begin with a deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

Let V and U be vector spaces over the same ﬁeld K. A mapping F : V ! U is called a
linear mapping or linear transformation if it satisﬁes the following two conditions:
(1) For any vectors v; w 2 V , Fðv þ wÞ ¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ.
(2) For any scalar k and vector v 2 V, FðkvÞ ¼ kFðvÞ.

Namely, F : V ! U is linear if it ‘‘preserves’’ the two basic operations of a vector space, that of
vector addition and that of scalar multiplication.
Substituting k ¼ 0 into condition (2), we obtain Fð0Þ ¼ 0. Thus, every linear mapping takes the zero
vector into the zero vector.
Now for any scalars a; b 2 K and any vector v; w 2 V , we obtain
Fðav þ bwÞ ¼ FðavÞ þ FðbwÞ ¼ aFðvÞ þ bFðwÞ
More generally, for any scalars ai 2 K and any vectors v i 2 V , we obtain the following basic property of
linear mappings:
Fða1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ am v m Þ ¼ a1 Fðv 1 Þ þ a2 Fðv 2 Þ þ    þ am Fðv m Þ
Remark 1:

A linear mapping F : V ! U is completely characterized by the condition

Fðav þ bwÞ ¼ aFðvÞ þ bFðwÞ

ð*Þ

and so this condition is sometimes used as its deﬁntion.
Remark 2: The term linear transformation rather than linear mapping is frequently used for linear
mappings of the form F : Rn ! Rm .
EXAMPLE 5.4

(a) Let F : R3 ! R3 be the ‘‘projection’’ mapping into the xy-plane; that is, F is the mapping deﬁned by
Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx; y; 0Þ. We show that F is linear. Let v ¼ ða; b; cÞ and w ¼ ða0 ; b0 ; c0 Þ. Then

Fðv þ wÞ ¼ Fða þ a0 ; b þ b0 ; c þ c0 Þ ¼ ða þ a0 ; b þ b0 ; 0Þ
¼ ða; b; 0Þ þ ða0 ; b0 ; 0Þ ¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ
and, for any scalar k,

FðkvÞ ¼ Fðka; kb; kcÞ ¼ ðka; kb; 0Þ ¼ kða; b; 0Þ ¼ kFðvÞ
Thus, F is linear.
(b) Let G : R2 ! R2 be the ‘‘translation’’ mapping deﬁned by Gðx; yÞ ¼ ðx þ 1; y þ 2Þ. [That is, G adds the vector
(1, 2) to any vector v ¼ ðx; yÞ in R2 .] Note that

Gð0Þ ¼ Gð0; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 2Þ 6¼ 0
Thus, the zero vector is not mapped into the zero vector. Hence, G is not linear.

168

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

(Derivative and Integral Mappings) Consider the vector space V ¼ PðtÞ of polynomials over the
real ﬁeld R. Let uðtÞ and vðtÞ be any polynomials in V and let k be any scalar.

EXAMPLE 5.5

(a) Let D : V ! V be the derivative mapping. One proves in calculus that

dðu þ vÞ du dv
¼
þ
dt
dt dt

dðkuÞ
du
¼k
dt
dt

and

That is, Dðu þ vÞ ¼ DðuÞ þ DðvÞ and DðkuÞ ¼ kDðuÞ. Thus, the derivative mapping is linear.
(b) Let J : V ! R be an integral mapping, say

ð1

Jð f ðtÞÞ ¼

f ðtÞ dt
0

One also proves in calculus that,

ð1

ð1
½uðtÞ þ vðtÞdt ¼

0

ð1
uðtÞ dt þ

0

vðtÞ dt
0

and

ð1

ð1
kuðtÞ dt ¼ k

0

uðtÞ dt
0

That is, Jðu þ vÞ ¼ JðuÞ þ JðvÞ and JðkuÞ ¼ kJðuÞ. Thus, the integral mapping is linear.
EXAMPLE 5.6

(Zero and Identity Mappings)

(a) Let F : V ! U be the mapping that assigns the zero vector 0 2 U to every vector v 2 V . Then, for any vectors
v; w 2 V and any scalar k 2 K, we have

Fðv þ wÞ ¼ 0 ¼ 0 þ 0 ¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ

and

FðkvÞ ¼ 0 ¼ k0 ¼ kFðvÞ

Thus, F is linear. We call F the zero mapping, and we usually denote it by 0.
(b) Consider the identity mapping I : V ! V , which maps each v 2 V into itself. Then, for any vectors v; w 2 V
and any scalars a; b 2 K, we have

Iðav þ bwÞ ¼ av þ bw ¼ aIðvÞ þ bIðwÞ
Thus, I is linear.

Our next theorem (proved in Problem 5.13) gives us an abundance of examples of linear mappings. In
particular, it tells us that a linear mapping is completely determined by its values on the elements of a basis.
THEOREM 5.2:

Let V and U be vector spaces over a ﬁeld K. Let fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g be a basis of V and
let u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un be any vectors in U . Then there exists a unique linear mapping
F : V ! U such that Fðv 1 Þ ¼ u1 ; Fðv 2 Þ ¼ u2 ; . . . ; Fðv n Þ ¼ un .

We emphasize that the vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un in Theorem 5.2 are completely arbitrary; they may be
linearly dependent or they may even be equal to each other.

Matrices as Linear Mappings
Let A be any real m n matrix. Recall that A determines a mapping FA : K n ! K m by FA ðuÞ ¼ Au
(where the vectors in K n and K m are written as columns). We show FA is linear. By matrix multiplication,
FA ðv þ wÞ ¼ Aðv þ wÞ ¼ Av þ Aw ¼ FA ðvÞ þ FA ðwÞ
FA ðkvÞ ¼ AðkvÞ ¼ kðAvÞ ¼ kFA ðvÞ
In other words, using A to represent the mapping, we have
Aðv þ wÞ ¼ Av þ Aw

and

Thus, the matrix mapping A is linear.

AðkvÞ ¼ kðAvÞ

169

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Vector Space Isomorphism
The notion of two vector spaces being isomorphic was deﬁned in Chapter 4 when we investigated the
coordinates of a vector relative to a basis. We now redeﬁne this concept.
DEFINITION:

Two vector spaces V and U over K are isomorphic, written V ﬃ U , if there exists a
bijective (one-to-one and onto) linear mapping F : V ! U . The mapping F is then
called an isomorphism between V and U .

Consider any vector space V of dimension n and let S be any basis of V. Then the mapping
v 7! ½vS
which maps each vector v 2 V into its coordinate vector ½vS , is an isomorphism between V and K n .

5.4

Kernel and Image of a Linear Mapping

We begin by deﬁning two concepts.
DEFINITION:

Let F : V ! U be a linear mapping. The kernel of F, written Ker F, is the set of
elements in V that map into the zero vector 0 in U ; that is,
Ker F ¼ fv 2 V : FðvÞ ¼ 0g
The image (or range) of F, written Im F, is the set of image points in U ; that is,
Im F ¼ fu 2 U : there exists v 2 V for which FðvÞ ¼ ug

The following theorem is easily proved (Problem 5.22).
THEOREM 5.3:

Let F : V ! U be a linear mapping. Then the kernel of F is a subspace of V and the
image of F is a subspace of U .

Now suppose that v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m span a vector space V and that F : V ! U is linear. We show that
Fðv 1 Þ; Fðv 2 Þ; . . . ; Fðv m Þ span Im F. Let u 2 Im F. Then there exists v 2 V such that FðvÞ ¼ u. Because
the v i ’s span V and v 2 V, there exist scalars a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; am for which
v ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ am v m
Therefore,
u ¼ FðvÞ ¼ Fða1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ am v m Þ ¼ a1 Fðv 1 Þ þ a2 Fðv 2 Þ þ    þ am Fðv m Þ
Thus, the vectors Fðv 1 Þ; Fðv 2 Þ; . . . ; Fðv m Þ span Im F.
We formally state the above result.
PROPOSITION 5.4:

Suppose v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m span a vector space V, and suppose F : V ! U is linear.
Then Fðv 1 Þ; Fðv 2 Þ; . . . ; Fðv m Þ span Im F.

EXAMPLE 5.7

(a) Let F : R3 ! R3 be the projection of a vector v into the xy-plane [as pictured in Fig. 5-2(a)]; that is,

Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx; y; 0Þ
Clearly the image of F is the entire xy-plane—that is, points of the form (x; y; 0). Moreover, the kernel of F is
the z-axis—that is, points of the form (0; 0; c). That is,

Im F ¼ fða; b; cÞ : c ¼ 0g ¼ xy-plane

and

Ker F ¼ fða; b; cÞ : a ¼ 0; b ¼ 0g ¼ z-axis

(b) Let G : R3 ! R3 be the linear mapping that rotates a vector v about the z-axis through an angle y [as pictured in
Fig. 5-2(b)]; that is,

Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx cos y  y sin y; x sin y þ y cos y; zÞ

170

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Figure 5-2

Observe that the distance of a vector v from the origin O does not change under the rotation, and so only the zero
vector 0 is mapped into the zero vector 0. Thus, Ker G ¼ f0g. On the other hand, every vector u in R3 is the image
of a vector v in R3 that can be obtained by rotating u back by an angle of y. Thus, Im G ¼ R3 , the entire space.
Consider the vector space V ¼ PðtÞ of polynomials over the real ﬁeld R, and let H : V ! V be the
third-derivative operator; that is, H½ f ðtÞ ¼ d 3 f =dt3 . [Sometimes the notation D3 is used for H, where D is the
derivative operator.] We claim that
EXAMPLE 5.8

Ker H ¼ fpolynomials of degree  2g ¼ P2 ðtÞ

and

Im H ¼ V

The ﬁrst comes from the fact that Hðat þ bt þ cÞ ¼ 0 but Hðt Þ 6¼ 0 for n  3. The second comes from that fact
that every polynomial gðtÞ in V is the third derivative of some polynomial f ðtÞ (which can be obtained by taking the
antiderivative of gðtÞ three times).

Kernel and Image of Matrix Mappings
Consider, say, a 3 4 matrix A and the usual basis fe1 ; e2 ; e3 ; e4 g of K 4 (written as columns):

Recall that A may be viewed as a linear mapping A : K 4 ! K 3 , where the vectors in K 4 and K 3 are
viewed as column vectors. Now the usual basis vectors span K 4 , so their images Ae1 , Ae2 , Ae3 , Ae4 span
the image of A. But the vectors Ae1 , Ae2 , Ae3 , Ae4 are precisely the columns of A:
Ae1 ¼ ½a1 ; b1 ; c1 T ;

Ae2 ¼ ½a2 ; b2 ; c2 T ;

Ae3 ¼ ½a3 ; b3 ; c3 T ;

Ae4 ¼ ½a4 ; b4 ; c4 T

Thus, the image of A is precisely the column space of A.
On the other hand, the kernel of A consists of all vectors v for which Av ¼ 0. This means that the
kernel of A is the solution space of the homogeneous system AX ¼ 0, called the null space of A.
We state the above results formally.
PROPOSITION 5.5:

Let A be any m

n matrix over a ﬁeld K viewed as a linear map A : K n ! K m . Then

Ker A ¼ nullspðAÞ

and

Im A ¼ colspðAÞ

Here colsp(A) denotes the column space of A, and nullsp(A) denotes the null space of A.

171

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Rank and Nullity of a Linear Mapping
Let F : V ! U be a linear mapping. The rank of F is deﬁned to be the dimension of its image, and the
nullity of F is deﬁned to be the dimension of its kernel; namely,
rankðFÞ ¼ dimðIm FÞ
and
nullityðFÞ ¼ dimðKer FÞ
The following important theorem (proved in Problem 5.23) holds.
Let V be of ﬁnite dimension, and let F : V ! U be linear. Then
dim V ¼ dimðKer FÞ þ dimðIm FÞ ¼ nullityðFÞ þ rankðFÞ

THEOREM 5.6

Recall that the rank of a matrix A was also deﬁned to be the dimension of its column space and row
space. If we now view A as a linear mapping, then both deﬁnitions correspond, because the image of A is
precisely its column space.
EXAMPLE 5.9

Let F : R4 ! R3 be the linear mapping deﬁned by

Fðx; y; z; tÞ ¼ ðx  y þ z þ t;

2x  2y þ 3z þ 4t;

3x  3y þ 4z þ 5tÞ

(a) Find a basis and the dimension of the image of F.
First ﬁnd the image of the usual basis vectors of R4 ,

Fð1; 0; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;
Fð0; 1; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ;

Fð0; 0; 1; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 3; 4Þ
Fð0; 0; 0; 1Þ ¼ ð1; 4; 5Þ

By Proposition 5.4, the image vectors span Im F. Hence, form the matrix M whose rows are these image vectors
and row reduce to echelon form:

Thus, (1, 2, 3) and (0, 1, 1) form a basis of Im F. Hence, dimðIm FÞ ¼ 2 and rankðFÞ ¼ 2.
(b) Find a basis and the dimension of the kernel of the map F.
Set FðvÞ ¼ 0, where v ¼ ðx; y; z; tÞ,

Fðx; y; z; tÞ ¼ ðx  y þ z þ t;

2x  2y þ 3z þ 4t;

3x  3y þ 4z þ 5tÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ

Set corresponding components equal to each other to form the following homogeneous system whose solution
space is Ker F:

x yþ zþ t ¼0
2x  2y þ 3z þ 4t ¼ 0
3x  3y þ 4z þ 5t ¼ 0

or

xyþzþ t ¼0
z þ 2t ¼ 0
z þ 2t ¼ 0

or

xyþzþ t ¼0
z þ 2t ¼ 0

The free variables are y and t. Hence, dimðKer FÞ ¼ 2 or nullityðFÞ ¼ 2.
(i) Set y ¼ 1, t ¼ 0 to obtain the solution (1; 1; 0; 0Þ,
(ii) Set y ¼ 0, t ¼ 1 to obtain the solution (1; 0; 2; 1Þ.
Thus, (1; 1; 0; 0) and (1; 0; 2; 1) form a basis for Ker F.
As expected from Theorem 5.6, dimðIm FÞ þ dimðKer FÞ ¼ 4 ¼ dim R4 .

Application to Systems of Linear Equations
Let AX ¼ B denote the matrix form of a system of m linear equations in n unknowns. Now the matrix A
may be viewed as a linear mapping
A : Kn ! Km

172

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Thus, the solution of the equation AX ¼ B may be viewed as the preimage of the vector B 2 K m under the
linear mapping A. Furthermore, the solution of the associated homogeneous system
AX ¼ 0
may be viewed as the kernel of the linear mapping A. Applying Theorem 5.6 to this homogeneous system
yields
dimðKer AÞ ¼ dim K n  dimðIm AÞ ¼ n  rank A
But n is exactly the number of unknowns in the homogeneous system AX ¼ 0. Thus, we have proved the
following theorem of Chapter 4.
THEOREM 4.19:

The dimension of the solution space W of a homogenous system AX ¼ 0 of linear
equations is s ¼ n  r, where n is the number of unknowns and r is the rank of the
coefﬁcient matrix A.

Observe that r is also the number of pivot variables in an echelon form of AX ¼ 0, so s ¼ n  r is also
the number of free variables. Furthermore, the s solution vectors of AX ¼ 0 described in Theorem 3.14
are linearly independent (Problem 4.52). Accordingly, because dim W ¼ s, they form a basis for the
solution space W. Thus, we have also proved Theorem 3.14.

5.5

Singular and Nonsingular Linear Mappings, Isomorphisms

Let F : V ! U be a linear mapping. Recall that Fð0Þ ¼ 0. F is said to be singular if the image of some
nonzero vector v is 0—that is, if there exists v 6¼ 0 such that FðvÞ ¼ 0. Thus, F : V ! U is nonsingular if
the zero vector 0 is the only vector whose image under F is 0 or, in other words, if Ker F ¼ f0g.
EXAMPLE 5.10 Consider the projection map F : R3 ! R3 and the rotation map G : R3 ! R3 appearing in

Fig. 5-2. (See Example 5.7.) Because the kernel of F is the z-axis, F is singular. On the other hand, the kernel of G
consists only of the zero vector 0. Thus, G is nonsingular.

Nonsingular linear mappings may also be characterized as those mappings that carry independent sets
into independent sets. Speciﬁcally, we prove (Problem 5.28) the following theorem.
THEOREM 5.7:

Let F : V ! U be a nonsingular linear mapping. Then the image of any linearly
independent set is linearly independent.

Isomorphisms
Suppose a linear mapping F : V ! U is one-to-one. Then only 0 2 V can map into 0 2 U , and so F is
nonsingular. The converse is also true. For suppose F is nonsingular and FðvÞ ¼ FðwÞ, then
Fðv  wÞ ¼ FðvÞ  FðwÞ ¼ 0, and hence, v  w ¼ 0 or v ¼ w. Thus, FðvÞ ¼ FðwÞ implies v ¼ w—
that is, F is one-to-one. We have proved the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 5.8:

A linear mapping F : V ! U is one-to-one if and only if F is nonsingular.

Recall that a mapping F : V ! U is called an isomorphism if F is linear and if F is bijective (i.e., if F
is one-to-one and onto). Also, recall that a vector space V is said to be isomorphic to a vector space U ,
written V ﬃ U , if there is an isomorphism F : V ! U .
The following theorem (proved in Problem 5.29) applies.
THEOREM 5.9:

Suppose V has ﬁnite dimension and dim V ¼ dim U. Suppose F : V ! U is linear.
Then F is an isomorphism if and only if F is nonsingular.

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Operations with Linear Mappings

We are able to combine linear mappings in various ways to obtain new linear mappings. These operations
are very important and will be used throughout the text.
Let F : V ! U and G : V ! U be linear mappings over a ﬁeld K. The sum F þ G and the scalar
product kF, where k 2 K, are deﬁned to be the following mappings from V into U :
ðF þ GÞðvÞ  FðvÞ þ GðvÞ

and

ðkFÞðvÞ  kFðvÞ

We now show that if F and G are linear, then F þ G and kF are also linear. Speciﬁcally, for any vectors
v; w 2 V and any scalars a; b 2 K,
ðF þ GÞðav þ bwÞ ¼ Fðav þ bwÞ þ Gðav þ bwÞ
¼ aFðvÞ þ bFðwÞ þ aGðvÞ þ bGðwÞ
¼ a½FðvÞ þ GðvÞ þ b½FðwÞ þ GðwÞ
¼ aðF þ GÞðvÞ þ bðF þ GÞðwÞ
ðkFÞðav þ bwÞ ¼ kFðav þ bwÞ ¼ k½aFðvÞ þ bFðwÞ

and

¼ akFðvÞ þ bkFðwÞ ¼ aðkFÞðvÞ þ bðkFÞðwÞ
Thus, F þ G and kF are linear.
The following theorem holds.
Let V and U be vector spaces over a ﬁeld K. Then the collection of all linear
mappings from V into U with the above operations of addition and scalar multiplication forms a vector space over K.

THEOREM 5.10:

The vector space of linear mappings in Theorem 5.10 is usually denoted by
HomðV; U Þ
Here Hom comes from the word ‘‘homomorphism.’’ We emphasize that the proof of Theorem 5.10
reduces to showing that HomðV; U Þ does satisfy the eight axioms of a vector space. The zero element of
HomðV; U Þ is the zero mapping from V into U , denoted by 0 and deﬁned by
0ðvÞ ¼ 0
for every vector v 2 V .
Suppose V and U are of ﬁnite dimension. Then we have the following theorem.
Suppose dim V ¼ m and dim U ¼ n. Then dim½HomðV ; U Þ ¼ mn.

THEOREM 5.11:

Composition of Linear Mappings
Now suppose V, U, and W are vector spaces over the same ﬁeld K, and suppose F : V ! U and
G : U ! W are linear mappings. We picture these mappings as follows:
F

G

V ! U ! W
Recall that the composition function G  F is the mapping from V into W deﬁned by
ðG  FÞðvÞ ¼ GðFðvÞÞ. We show that G  F is linear whenever F and G are linear. Speciﬁcally, for
any vectors v; w 2 V and any scalars a; b 2 K, we have
ðG  FÞðav þ bwÞ ¼ GðFðav þ bwÞÞ ¼ GðaFðvÞ þ bFðwÞÞ
¼ aGðFðvÞÞ þ bGðFðwÞÞ ¼ aðG  FÞðvÞ þ bðG  FÞðwÞ
Thus, G  F is linear.
The composition of linear mappings and the operations of addition and scalar multiplication are
related as follows.

174

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

THEOREM 5.12:

Let V, U, W be vector spaces over K. Suppose the following mappings are linear:
F0 : V ! U

F : V ! U;

and

G : U ! W;

G0 : U ! W

Then, for any scalar k 2 K:
(i) G  ðF þ F 0 Þ ¼ G  F þ G  F 0 .
(ii) ðG þ G0 Þ  F ¼ G  F þ G0  F.
(iii) kðG  FÞ ¼ ðkGÞ  F ¼ G  ðkFÞ.

5.7

Algebra AðVÞ of Linear Operators

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K. This section considers the special case of linear mappings from the
vector space V into itself—that is, linear mappings of the form F : V ! V. They are also called linear
operators or linear transformations on V. We will write AðV Þ, instead of HomðV; V Þ, for the space of all
such mappings.
Now AðV Þ is a vector space over K (Theorem 5.8), and, if dim V ¼ n, then dim AðV Þ ¼ n2 . Moreover,
for any mappings F; G 2 AðV Þ, the composition G  F exists and also belongs to AðV Þ. Thus, we have a
‘‘multiplication’’ deﬁned in AðV Þ. [We sometimes write FG instead of G  F in the space AðV Þ.]
Remark: An algebra A over a ﬁeld K is a vector space over K in which an operation of
multiplication is deﬁned satisfying, for every F; G; H 2 A and every k 2 K:
(i) FðG þ HÞ ¼ FG þ FH,
(ii) ðG þ HÞF ¼ GF þ HF,
(iii) kðGFÞ ¼ ðkGÞF ¼ GðkFÞ.
The algebra is said to be associative if, in addition, ðFGÞH ¼ FðGHÞ.
The above deﬁnition of an algebra and previous theorems give us the following result.
THEOREM 5.13:

Let V be a vector space over K. Then AðV Þ is an associative algebra over K with
respect to composition of mappings. If dim V ¼ n, then dim AðV Þ ¼ n2 .

This is why AðV Þ is called the algebra of linear operators on V .

Polynomials and Linear Operators
Observe that the identity mapping I : V ! V belongs to AðV Þ. Also, for any linear operator F in AðV Þ,
we have FI ¼ IF ¼ F. We can also form ‘‘powers’’ of F. Namely, we deﬁne
F 0 ¼ I;

F 2 ¼ F  F;

F 3 ¼ F 2  F ¼ F  F  F;

F 4 ¼ F 3  F;

...

Furthermore, for any polynomial pðtÞ over K, say,
pðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1 t þ a2 t2 þ    þ as t2
we can form the linear operator pðFÞ deﬁned by
pðFÞ ¼ a0 I þ a1 F þ a2 F 2 þ    þ as F s
(For any scalar k, the operator kI is sometimes denoted simply by k.) In particular, we say F is a zero of
the polynomial pðtÞ if pðFÞ ¼ 0.
EXAMPLE 5.11 Let F : K 3 ! K 3 be deﬁned by Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð0; x; yÞ. For any ða; b; cÞ 2 K 3 ,

ðF þ IÞða; b; cÞ ¼ ð0; a; bÞ þ ða; b; cÞ ¼ ða; a þ b; b þ cÞ
F 3 ða; b; cÞ ¼ F 2 ð0; a; bÞ ¼ Fð0; 0; aÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ
Thus, F 3 ¼ 0, the zero mapping in AðV Þ. This means F is a zero of the polynomial pðtÞ ¼ t3 .

175

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Square Matrices as Linear Operators
Let M ¼ Mn;n be the vector space of all square n n matrices over K. Then any matrix A in M deﬁnes a
linear mapping FA : K n ! K n by FA ðuÞ ¼ Au (where the vectors in K n are written as columns). Because the
mapping is from K n into itself, the square matrix A is a linear operator, not simply a linear mapping.
Suppose A and B are matrices in M. Then the matrix product AB is deﬁned. Furthermore, for any
(column) vector u in K n ,
FAB ðuÞ ¼ ðABÞu ¼ AðBuÞ ¼ AðFB ðU ÞÞ ¼ FA ðFB ðuÞÞ ¼ ðFA  FB ÞðuÞ
In other words, the matrix product AB corresponds to the composition of A and B as linear mappings.
Similarly, the matrix sum A þ B corresponds to the sum of A and B as linear mappings, and the scalar
product kA corresponds to the scalar product of A as a linear mapping.

Invertible Operators in AðVÞ
Let F : V ! V be a linear operator. F is said to be invertible if it has an inverse—that is, if there exists
F 1 in AðV Þ such that FF 1 ¼ F 1 F ¼ I. On the other hand, F is invertible as a mapping if F is both
one-to-one and onto. In such a case, F 1 is also linear and F 1 is the inverse of F as a linear operator
(proved in Problem 5.15).
Suppose F is invertible. Then only 0 2 V can map into itself, and so F is nonsingular. The converse is
not true, as seen by the following example.
EXAMPLE 5.12 Let V ¼ PðtÞ, the vector space of polynomials over K. Let F be the mapping on V that increases
by 1 the exponent of t in each term of a polynomial; that is,

Fða0 þ a1 t þ a2 t2 þ    þ as ts Þ ¼ a0 t þ a1 t2 þ a2 t3 þ    þ as tsþ1
Then F is a linear mapping and F is nonsingular. However, F is not onto, and so F is not invertible.

The vector space V ¼ PðtÞ in the above example has inﬁnite dimension. The situation changes
signiﬁcantly when V has ﬁnite dimension. Namely, the following theorem applies.
THEOREM 5.14:

Let F be a linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V . Then the following
four conditions are equivalent.
(i) F is nonsingular: Ker F ¼ f0g.
(ii) F is one-to-one.

(iii) F is an onto mapping.
(iv) F is invertible.

The proof of the above theorem mainly follows from Theorem 5.6, which tells us that
dim V ¼ dimðKer FÞ þ dimðIm FÞ
By Proposition 5.8, (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Note that (iv) is equivalent to (ii) and (iii). Thus, to prove
the theorem, we need only show that (i) and (iii) are equivalent. This we do below.
(a) Suppose (i) holds. Then dimðKer FÞ ¼ 0, and so the above equation tells us that dim V ¼ dimðIm FÞ.
This means V ¼ Im F or, in other words, F is an onto mapping. Thus, (i) implies (iii).
(b) Suppose (iii) holds. Then V ¼ Im F, and so dim V ¼ dimðIm FÞ. Therefore, the above equation
tells us that dimðKer FÞ ¼ 0, and so F is nonsingular. Therefore, (iii) implies (i).
Accordingly, all four conditions are equivalent.
Remark: Suppose A is a square n n matrix over K. Then A may be viewed as a linear operator on
K n . Because K n has ﬁnite dimension, Theorem 5.14 holds for the square matrix A. This is why the terms
‘‘nonsingular’’ and ‘‘invertible’’ are used interchangeably when applied to square matrices.
EXAMPLE 5.13 Let F be the linear operator on R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x þ y; 3x þ 2yÞ.

(a) To show that F is invertible, we need only show that F is nonsingular. Set Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ to obtain the
homogeneous system

2x þ y ¼ 0

and

3x þ 2y ¼ 0

176

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Solve for x and y to get x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0. Hence, F is nonsingular and so invertible.
(b) To ﬁnd a formula for F 1 , we set Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðs; tÞ and so F 1 ðs; tÞ ¼ ðx; yÞ. We have

ð2x þ y; 3x þ 2yÞ ¼ ðs; tÞ

2x þ y ¼ s
3x þ 2y ¼ t

or

Solve for x and y in terms of s and t to obtain x ¼ 2s  t, y ¼ 3s þ 2t. Thus,

F 1 ðs; tÞ ¼ ð2s  t; 3s þ 2tÞ

or

F 1 ðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x  y; 3x þ 2yÞ

where we rewrite the formula for F 1 using x and y instead of s and t.

ðg  f Þ ðbÞ ¼ gð f ðbÞÞ ¼ gðxÞ ¼ s

ðg  f Þ ðcÞ ¼ gð f ðcÞÞ ¼ gðyÞ ¼ t
Observe that we arrive at the same answer if we ‘‘follow the arrows’’ in Fig. 5-4:
a ! y ! t;

b ! x ! s;

c!y!t

(b) By Fig. 5-4, the image values under the mapping f are x and y, and the image values under g are r, s, t.

177

Hence,
Im f ¼ fx; yg

Im g ¼ fr; s; tg

and

Also, by part (a), the image values under the composition mapping g  f are t and s; accordingly,
Im g  f ¼ fs; tg. Note that the images of g and g  f are different.

(a) Substitute in the formula for F to get Fð2; 3; 4Þ ¼ ð3  4; 22 Þ ¼ ð12; 4Þ.
(b) Fð5; 2; 7Þ ¼ ð2  7; 52 Þ ¼ ð14; 25Þ.
(c) Set FðvÞ ¼ 0, where v ¼ ðx; y; zÞ, and then solve for x, y, z:
Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðyz; x2 Þ ¼ ð0; 0Þ

yz ¼ 0; x2 ¼ 0

or

Thus, x ¼ 0 and either y ¼ 0 or z ¼ 0. In other words, x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0 or x ¼ 0; z ¼ 0—that is, the z-axis
and the y-axis.

5.4.

Consider the mapping F : R2 ! R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð3y; 2xÞ. Let S be the unit circle in R2 ,
that is, the solution set of x2 þ y2 ¼ 1. (a) Describe FðSÞ. (b) Find F 1 ðSÞ.
(a) Let (a; b) be an element of FðSÞ. Then there exists ðx; yÞ 2 S such that Fðx; yÞ ¼ ða; bÞ. Hence,
ð3y; 2xÞ ¼ ða; bÞ

3y ¼ a; 2x ¼ b

Thus, FðSÞ is an ellipse.

have a2 þ b2 ¼ 1. Thus, ð3yÞ2 þ ð2xÞ2 ¼ 1. Accordingly, F 1 ðSÞ is the ellipse 4x2 þ 9y2 ¼ 1.

Let the mappings f : A ! B, g : B ! C, h : C ! D be deﬁned by Fig. 5-5. Determine whether or
not each function is (a) one-to-one; (b) onto; (c) invertible (i.e., has an inverse).
(a) The mapping f : A ! B is one-to-one, as each element of A has a different image. The mapping
g : B ! C is not one-to one, because x and z both have the same image 4. The mapping h : C ! D is
one-to-one.
(b) The mapping f : A ! B is not onto, because z 2 B is not the image of any element of A. The mapping
g : B ! C is onto, as each element of C is the image of some element of B. The mapping h : C ! D is
also onto.
(c) A mapping has an inverse if and only if it is one-to-one and onto. Hence, only h has an inverse.

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Suppose f : A ! B and g : B ! C. Hence, ðg  f Þ : A ! C exists. Prove
(a) If f and g are one-to-one, then g  f is one-to-one.
(b) If f and g are onto mappings, then g  f is an onto mapping.
(c) If g  f is one-to-one, then f is one-to-one.
(d) If g  f is an onto mapping, then g is an onto mapping.
(a) Suppose ðg  f ÞðxÞ ¼ ðg  f ÞðyÞ. Then gð f ðxÞÞ ¼ gð f ðyÞÞ. Because g is one-to-one, f ðxÞ ¼ f ðyÞ.
Because f is one-to-one, x ¼ y. We have proven that ðg  f ÞðxÞ ¼ ðg  f ÞðyÞ implies x ¼ y; hence g  f
is one-to-one.
(b) Suppose c 2 C. Because g is onto, there exists b 2 B for which gðbÞ ¼ c. Because f is onto, there exists
a 2 A for which f ðaÞ ¼ b. Thus, ðg  f ÞðaÞ ¼ gð f ðaÞÞ ¼ gðbÞ ¼ c. Hence, g  f is onto.
(c) Suppose f is not one-to-one. Then there exist distinct elements x; y 2 A for which f ðxÞ ¼ f ðyÞ. Thus,
ðg  f ÞðxÞ ¼ gð f ðxÞÞ ¼ gð f ðyÞÞ ¼ ðg  f ÞðyÞ. Hence, g  f is not one-to-one. Therefore, if g  f is one-toone, then f must be one-to-one.
(d) If a 2 A, then ðg  f ÞðaÞ ¼ gð f ðaÞÞ 2 gðBÞ. Hence, ðg  f ÞðAÞ  gðBÞ. Suppose g is not onto. Then gðBÞ
is properly contained in C and so ðg  f ÞðAÞ is properly contained in C; thus, g  f is not onto.
Accordingly, if g  f is onto, then g must be onto.

5.7.

Prove that f : A ! B has an inverse if and only if f is one-to-one and onto.
Suppose f has an inverse—that is, there exists a function f 1 : B ! A for which f 1  f ¼ 1A and
1
f  f ¼ 1B . Because 1A is one-to-one, f is one-to-one by Problem 5.6(c), and because 1B is onto, f is onto
by Problem 5.6(d); that is, f is both one-to-one and onto.
Now suppose f is both one-to-one and onto. Then each b 2 B is the image of a unique element in A, say
b*. Thus, if f ðaÞ ¼ b, then a ¼ b*; hence, f ðb*Þ ¼ b. Now let g denote the mapping from B to A deﬁned by
b 7! b*. We have
(i) ðg  f ÞðaÞ ¼ gð f ðaÞÞ ¼ gðbÞ ¼ b* ¼ a for every a 2 A; hence, g  f ¼ 1A .
(ii)

ð f  gÞðbÞ ¼ f ðgðbÞÞ ¼ f ðb*Þ ¼ b for every b 2 B; hence, f  g ¼ 1B .

Accordingly, f has an inverse. Its inverse is the mapping g.

5.8.

Let f : R ! R be deﬁned by f ðxÞ ¼ 2x  3. Now f is one-to-one and onto; hence, f has an inverse
mapping f 1 . Find a formula for f 1 .
Let y be the image of x under the mapping f ; that is, y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ 2x  3. Hence, x will be the image of y
under the inverse mapping f 1 . Thus, solve for x in terms of y in the above equation to obtain x ¼ 12 ðy þ 3Þ.
Then the formula deﬁning the inverse function is f 1 ðyÞ ¼ 12 ðy þ 3Þ, or, using x instead of y, f 1 ðxÞ ¼ 12 ðx þ 3Þ.

Linear Mappings
5.9.

Suppose the mapping F : R2 ! R2 is deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðx þ y; xÞ. Show that F is linear.
We need to show that Fðv þ wÞ ¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ and FðkvÞ ¼ kFðvÞ, where u and v are any elements of
R2 and k is any scalar. Let v ¼ ða; bÞ and w ¼ ða0 ; b0 Þ. Then

v þ w ¼ ða þ a0 ; b þ b0 Þ

and

kv ¼ ðka; kbÞ

We have FðvÞ ¼ ða þ b; aÞ and FðwÞ ¼ ða0 þ b0 ; a0 Þ. Thus,

Fðv þ wÞ ¼ Fða þ a0 ; b þ b0 Þ ¼ ða þ a0 þ b þ b0 ; a þ a0 Þ
¼ ða þ b; aÞ þ ða0 þ b0 ; a0 Þ ¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ
and
FðkvÞ ¼ Fðka; kbÞ ¼ ðka þ kb; kaÞ ¼ kða þ b; aÞ ¼ kFðvÞ
Because v, w, k were arbitrary, F is linear.

5.10. Suppose F : R3 ! R2 is deﬁned by Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx þ y þ z; 2x  3y þ 4zÞ. Show that F is linear.

FðvÞ ¼ Av, where v ¼ ½x; y; zT and

Then, using properties of matrices, we have
Fðv þ wÞ ¼ Aðv þ wÞ ¼ Av þ Aw ¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ
FðkvÞ ¼ AðkvÞ ¼ kðAvÞ ¼ kFðvÞ

and
Thus, F is linear.

5.11. Show that the following mappings are not linear:
(a)

F : R2 ! R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðxy; xÞ

(b)

F : R2 ! R3 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðx þ 3; 2y; x þ yÞ

(c)

F : R3 ! R2 deﬁned by Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðjxj; y þ zÞ

(a) Let v ¼ ð1; 2Þ and w ¼ ð3; 4Þ; then v þ w ¼ ð4; 6Þ. Also,
FðvÞ ¼ ð1ð2Þ; 1Þ ¼ ð2; 1Þ

and

FðwÞ ¼ ð3ð4Þ; 3Þ ¼ ð12; 3Þ

Hence,
Fðv þ wÞ ¼ ð4ð6Þ; 4Þ ¼ ð24; 6Þ 6¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ
(b) Because Fð0; 0Þ ¼ ð3; 0; 0Þ 6¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ, F cannot be linear.
(c) Let v ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ and k ¼ 3. Then kv ¼ ð3; 6; 9Þ. We have
FðvÞ ¼ ð1; 5Þ and

kFðvÞ ¼ 3ð1; 5Þ ¼ ð3; 15Þ:

Thus,
FðkvÞ ¼ Fð3; 6; 9Þ ¼ ð3; 15Þ 6¼ kFðvÞ
Accordingly, F is not linear.

5.12. Let V be the vector space of n-square real matrices. Let M be an arbitrary but ﬁxed matrix in V .
Let F : V ! V be deﬁned by FðAÞ ¼ AM þ MA, where A is any matrix in V . Show that F is
linear.
For any matrices A and B in V and any scalar k, we have
FðA þ BÞ ¼ ðA þ BÞM þ MðA þ BÞ ¼ AM þ BM þ MA þ MB
¼ ðAM þ MAÞ ¼ ðBM þ MBÞ ¼ FðAÞ þ FðBÞ
and
FðkAÞ ¼ ðkAÞM þ MðkAÞ ¼ kðAMÞ þ kðMAÞ ¼ kðAM þ MAÞ ¼ kFðAÞ
Thus, F is linear.

5.13. Prove Theorem 5.2: Let V and U be vector spaces over a ﬁeld K. Let fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g be a basis of
V and let u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un be any vectors in U . Then there exists a unique linear mapping F : V ! U
such that Fðv 1 Þ ¼ u1 ; Fðv 2 Þ ¼ u2 ; . . . ; Fðv n Þ ¼ un .
There are three steps to the proof of the theorem: (1) Deﬁne the mapping F : V ! U such that
Fðv i Þ ¼ ui ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; n. (2) Show that F is linear. (3) Show that F is unique.
Step 1. Let v 2 V . Because fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g is a basis of V, there exist unique scalars a1 ; . . . ; an 2 K for
which v ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n . We deﬁne F : V ! U by
FðvÞ ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un

180

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings
(Because the ai are unique, the mapping F is well deﬁned.) Now, for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n,
v i ¼ 0v 1 þ    þ 1v i þ    þ 0v n
Hence,
Fðv i Þ ¼ 0u1 þ    þ 1ui þ    þ 0un ¼ ui

Thus, the ﬁrst step of the proof is complete.
Step 2. Suppose v ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n and w ¼ b1 v 1 þ b2 v 2 þ    þ bn v n . Then
v þ w ¼ ða1 þ b1 Þv 1 þ ða2 þ b2 Þv 2 þ    þ ðan þ bn Þv n
and, for any k 2 K, kv ¼ ka1 v 1 þ ka2 v 2 þ    þ kan v n . By deﬁnition of the mapping F,
FðvÞ ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an v n

FðwÞ ¼ b1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ    þ bn un

and

Hence,
Fðv þ wÞ ¼ ða1 þ b1 Þu1 þ ða2 þ b2 Þu2 þ    þ ðan þ bn Þun
¼ ða1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un Þ þ ðb1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ    þ bn un Þ
¼ FðvÞ þ FðwÞ
and
FðkvÞ ¼ kða1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un Þ ¼ kFðvÞ
Thus, F is linear.
Step 3. Suppose G : V ! U is linear and Gðv 1 Þ ¼ ui ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; n. Let
v ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n
Then
GðvÞ ¼ Gða1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n Þ ¼ a1 Gðv 1 Þ þ a2 Gðv 2 Þ þ    þ an Gðv n Þ
¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un ¼ FðvÞ
Because GðvÞ ¼ FðvÞ for every v 2 V ; G ¼ F. Thus, F is unique and the theorem is proved.

5.14. Let F : R2 ! R2 be the linear mapping for which Fð1; 2Þ ¼ ð2; 3Þ and Fð0; 1Þ ¼ ð1; 4Þ. [Note that
fð1; 2Þ; ð0; 1Þg is a basis of R2 , so such a linear map F exists and is unique by Theorem 5.2.] Find
a formula for F; that is, ﬁnd Fða; bÞ.
Write ða; bÞ as a linear combination of (1, 2) and (0, 1) using unknowns x and y,
ða; bÞ ¼ xð1; 2Þ þ yð0; 1Þ ¼ ðx; 2x þ yÞ;
Solve for x and y in terms of a and b to get

x ¼ a,

so

a ¼ x; b ¼ 2x þ y

y ¼ 2a þ b. Then

Fða; bÞ ¼ xFð1; 2Þ þ yFð0; 1Þ ¼ að2; 3Þ þ ð2a þ bÞð1; 4Þ ¼ ðb; 5a þ 4bÞ

5.15. Suppose a linear mapping F : V ! U is one-to-one and onto. Show that the inverse mapping
F 1 : U ! V is also linear.
Suppose u; u0 2 U . Because F is one-to-one and onto, there exist unique vectors v; v 0 2 V for which
FðvÞ ¼ u and Fðv 0 Þ ¼ u0 . Because F is linear, we also have
Fðv þ v 0 Þ ¼ FðvÞ þ Fðv 0 Þ ¼ u þ u0

and

FðkvÞ ¼ kFðvÞ ¼ ku

By deﬁnition of the inverse mapping,
F 1 ðuÞ ¼ v; F 1 ðu0 Þ ¼ v 0 ; F 1 ðu þ u0 Þ ¼ v þ v 0 ; F 1 ðkuÞ ¼ kv:
Then
F 1 ðu þ u0 Þ ¼ v þ v 0 ¼ F 1 ðuÞ þ F 1 ðu0 Þ
Thus, F 1 is linear.

and

F 1 ðkuÞ ¼ kv ¼ kF 1 ðuÞ

181

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings
Kernel and Image of Linear Mappings
5.16. Let F : R4 ! R3 be the linear mapping deﬁned by
Fðx; y; z; tÞ ¼ ðx  y þ z þ t;

x þ 2z  t;

x þ y þ 3z  3tÞ

Find a basis and the dimension of (a) the image of F; (b) the kernel of F.
(a) Find the images of the usual basis of R4 :
Fð1; 0; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ;

Fð0; 0; 1; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ

Fð0; 1; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 0; 1Þ;

Fð0; 0; 0; 1Þ ¼ ð1; 1; 3Þ

By Proposition 5.4, the image vectors span Im F. Hence, form the matrix whose rows are these image
vectors, and row reduce to echelon form:

Thus, (1, 1, 1) and (0, 1, 2) form a basis for Im F; hence, dimðIm FÞ ¼ 2.
(b) Set FðvÞ ¼ 0, where v ¼ ðx; y; z; tÞ; that is, set
Fðx; y; z; tÞ ¼ ðx  y þ z þ t; x þ 2z  t; x þ y þ 3z  3tÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ
Set corresponding entries equal to each other to form the following homogeneous system whose solution
space is Ker F:
xyþ zþ t ¼0
x
þ 2z  t ¼ 0
x þ y þ 3z  3t ¼ 0

xyþ zþ t ¼0
y þ z  2t ¼ 0
2y þ 2z  4t ¼ 0

or

or

xyþzþ t ¼0
y þ z  2t ¼ 0

The free variables are z and t. Hence, dimðKer FÞ ¼ 2.
(i) Set z ¼ 1, t ¼ 0 to obtain the solution (2; 1; 1; 0).
(ii) Set z ¼ 0, t ¼ 1 to obtain the solution (1, 2, 0, 1).
Thus, (2; 1; 1; 0) and (1, 2, 0, 1) form a basis of Ker F.
[As expected, dimðIm FÞ þ dimðKer FÞ ¼ 2 þ 2 ¼ 4 ¼ dim R4 , the domain of F.]

5.17. Let G : R3 ! R3 be the linear mapping deﬁned by
Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx þ 2y  z;

y þ z;

x þ y  2zÞ

Find a basis and the dimension of (a) the image of G, (b) the kernel of G.
(a) Find the images of the usual basis of R3 :
Gð1; 0; 0Þ ¼ ð1; 0; 1Þ;

Gð0; 1; 0Þ ¼ ð2; 1; 1Þ;

Gð0; 0; 1Þ ¼ ð1; 1; 2Þ

By Proposition 5.4, the image vectors span Im G. Hence, form the matrix M whose rows are these image
vectors, and row reduce to echelon form:

Thus, (1, 0, 1) and (0; 1; 1) form a basis for Im G; hence, dimðIm GÞ ¼ 2.
(b) Set GðvÞ ¼ 0, where v ¼ ðx; y; zÞ; that is,
Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx þ 2y  z;

y þ z;

x þ y  2zÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ

182

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings
Set corresponding entries equal to each other to form the following homogeneous system whose solution
space is Ker G:
x þ 2y  z ¼ 0

x þ y  2z ¼ 0

or

x þ 2y  z ¼ 0
yþz¼0
y  z ¼ 0

x þ 2y  z ¼ 0
yþz¼0

or

The only free variable is z; hence, dimðKer GÞ ¼ 1. Set z ¼ 1; then y ¼ 1 and x ¼ 3. Thus, (3; 1; 1)
forms a basis of Ker G. [As expected, dimðIm GÞ þ dimðKer GÞ ¼ 2 þ 1 ¼ 3 ¼ dim R3 , the domain
of G.]

Thus, fð1; 1; 3Þ; ð0; 1; 2Þg is a basis of Im A, and dimðIm AÞ ¼ 2.
(b) Here Ker A is the solution space of the homogeneous system AX ¼ 0, where X ¼ fx; y; z; tÞT . Thus,
reduce the matrix A of coefﬁcients to echelon form:

The free variables are z and t. Thus, dimðKer AÞ ¼ 2.
(i) Set z ¼ 1, t ¼ 0 to get the solution (1; 2; 1; 0).
(ii) Set z ¼ 0, t ¼ 1 to get the solution (7; 3; 0; 1).
Thus, (1; 2; 1; 0) and (7; 3; 0; 1) form a basis for Ker A.

5.19. Find a linear map F : R3 ! R4 whose image is spanned by (1; 2; 0; 4) and (2; 0; 1; 3).

Recall that A determines a linear map A : R3 ! R4 whose image is spanned by the columns of A. Thus, A
satisﬁes the required condition.

5.20. Suppose f : V ! U is linear with kernel W, and that f ðvÞ ¼ u. Show that the ‘‘coset’’
v þ W ¼ fv þ w : w 2 W g is the preimage of u; that is, f 1 ðuÞ ¼ v þ W.
We must prove that (i) f 1 ðuÞ  v þ W and (ii) v þ W  f 1 ðuÞ.
We ﬁrst prove (i). Suppose v 0 2 f 1 ðuÞ. Then f ðv 0 Þ ¼ u, and so
f ðv 0  vÞ ¼ f ðv 0 Þ  f ðvÞ ¼ u  u ¼ 0
that is, v 0  v 2 W . Thus, v 0 ¼ v þ ðv 0  vÞ 2 v þ W , and hence f 1 ðuÞ  v þ W .

183

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

Now we prove (ii). Suppose v 0 2 v þ W . Then v 0 ¼ v þ w, where w 2 W . Because W is the kernel of f ;
we have f ðwÞ ¼ 0. Accordingly,
f ðv 0 Þ ¼ f ðv þ wÞ þ f ðvÞ þ f ðwÞ ¼ f ðvÞ þ 0 ¼ f ðvÞ ¼ u
Thus, v 0 2 f 1 ðuÞ, and so v þ W  f 1 ðuÞ.
Both inclusions imply f 1 ðuÞ ¼ v þ W.

5.21. Suppose F : V ! U and G : U ! W are linear. Prove
(a) rankðG  FÞ  rankðGÞ,

(b) rankðG  FÞ  rankðFÞ.

(a) Because FðV Þ  U , we also have GðFðV ÞÞ  GðU Þ, and so dim½GðFðV ÞÞ  dim½GðU Þ. Then
rankðG  FÞ ¼ dim½ðG  FÞðV Þ ¼ dim½GðFðV ÞÞ  dim½GðU Þ ¼ rankðGÞ.
(b) We have dim½GðFðV ÞÞ  dim½FðV Þ. Hence,
rankðG  FÞ ¼ dim½ðG  FÞðV Þ ¼ dim½GðFðV ÞÞ  dim½FðV Þ ¼ rankðFÞ

5.22. Prove Theorem 5.3: Let F : V ! U be linear. Then,
(a) Im F is a subspace of U, (b) Ker F is a subspace of V.
(a)

Because Fð0Þ ¼ 0; we have 0 2 Im F. Now suppose u; u0 2 Im F and a; b 2 K. Because u and u0
belong to the image of F, there exist vectors v; v 0 2 V such that FðvÞ ¼ u and Fðv 0 Þ ¼ u0 . Then
Fðav þ bv 0 Þ ¼ aFðvÞ þ bFðv 0 Þ ¼ au þ bu0 2 Im F
Thus, the image of F is a subspace of U .

(b)

Because Fð0Þ ¼ 0; we have 0 2 Ker F. Now suppose v; w 2 Ker F and a; b 2 K. Because v and w
belong to the kernel of F, FðvÞ ¼ 0 and FðwÞ ¼ 0. Thus,
Fðav þ bwÞ ¼ aFðvÞ þ bFðwÞ ¼ a0 þ b0 ¼ 0 þ 0 ¼ 0;

and so

av þ bw 2 Ker F

Thus, the kernel of F is a subspace of V.

5.23. Prove Theorem 5.6: Suppose V has ﬁnite dimension and F : V ! U is linear. Then
dim V ¼ dimðKer FÞ þ dimðIm FÞ ¼ nullityðFÞ þ rankðFÞ
Suppose dimðKer FÞ ¼ r and fw1 ; . . . ; wr g is a basis of Ker F, and suppose dimðIm FÞ ¼ s and
fu1 ; . . . ; us g is a basis of Im F. (By Proposition 5.4, Im F has ﬁnite dimension.) Because every
uj 2 Im F, there exist vectors v 1 ; . . . ; v s in V such that Fðv 1 Þ ¼ u1 ; . . . ; Fðv s Þ ¼ us . We claim that the set
B ¼ fw1 ; . . . ; wr ; v 1 ; . . . ; v s g
is a basis of V; that is, (i) B spans V, and (ii) B is linearly independent. Once we prove (i) and (ii), then
dim V ¼ r þ s ¼ dimðKer FÞ þ dimðIm FÞ.
(i) B spans V . Let v 2 V . Then FðvÞ 2 Im F. Because the uj span Im F, there exist scalars a1 ; . . . ; as such
that FðvÞ ¼ a1 u1 þ    þ as us . Set v^ ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ as v s  v. Then
Fð^
v Þ ¼ Fða1 v 1 þ    þ as v s  vÞ ¼ a1 Fðv 1 Þ þ    þ as Fðv s Þ  FðvÞ
¼ a1 u1 þ    þ as us  FðvÞ ¼ 0
Thus, v^ 2 Ker F. Because the wi span Ker F, there exist scalars b1 ; . . . ; br , such that
v^ ¼ b1 w1 þ    þ br wr ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ as v s  v
Accordingly,
v ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ as v s  b1 w1      br wr
Thus, B spans V.

184
(ii)

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings
B is linearly independent. Suppose
x1 w1 þ    þ xr wr þ y1 v 1 þ    þ ys v s ¼ 0

ð1Þ

0 ¼ Fð0Þ ¼ Fðx1 w1 þ    þ xr wr þ y1 v 1 þ    þ ys v s Þ
¼ x1 Fðw1 Þ þ    þ xr Fðwr Þ þ y1 Fðv 1 Þ þ    þ ys Fðv s Þ

ð2Þ

where xi ; yj 2 K. Then

But Fðwi Þ ¼ 0, since wi 2 Ker F, and Fðv j Þ ¼ uj . Substituting into (2), we will obtain
y1 u1 þ    þ ys us ¼ 0. Since the uj are linearly independent, each yj ¼ 0. Substitution into (1) gives
x1 w1 þ    þ xr wr ¼ 0. Since the wi are linearly independent, each xi ¼ 0. Thus B is linearly
independent.

Singular and Nonsingular Linear Maps, Isomorphisms
5.24. Determine whether or not each of the following linear maps is nonsingular. If not, ﬁnd a nonzero
vector v whose image is 0.
(a) F : R2 ! R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðx  y; x  2yÞ.
(b) G : R2 ! R2 deﬁned by Gðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x  4y; 3x  6yÞ.
(a) Find Ker F by setting FðvÞ ¼ 0, where v ¼ ðx; yÞ,
ðx  y; x  2yÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ

x y¼0
x  2y ¼ 0

or

xy¼0
y ¼ 0

or

The only solution is x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0. Hence, F is nonsingular.
(b) Set Gðx; yÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ to ﬁnd Ker G:
ð2x  4y; 3x  6yÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ

2x  4y ¼ 0
3x  6y ¼ 0

or

x  2y ¼ 0

or

The system has nonzero solutions, because y is a free variable. Hence, G is singular. Let y ¼ 1 to obtain
the solution v ¼ ð2; 1Þ, which is a nonzero vector, such that GðvÞ ¼ 0.

5.25. The linear map F : R2 ! R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðx  y; x  2yÞ is nonsingular by the previous
Problem 5.24. Find a formula for F 1 .
Set Fðx; yÞ ¼ ða; bÞ, so that F 1 ða; bÞ ¼ ðx; yÞ. We have
ðx  y; x  2yÞ ¼ ða; bÞ

or

x y¼a
x  2y ¼ b

or

xy¼a
y¼ab

Solve for x and y in terms of a and b to get x ¼ 2a  b, y ¼ a  b. Thus,
F 1 ða; bÞ ¼ ð2a  b; a  bÞ

or

F 1 ðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x  y; x  yÞ

(The second equation is obtained by replacing a and b by x and y, respectively.)

5.26. Let G : R2 ! R3 be deﬁned by Gðx; yÞ ¼ ðx þ y; x  2y; 3x þ yÞ.
(a)

Show that G is nonsingular. (b) Find a formula for G1 .

(a)

Set Gðx; yÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ to ﬁnd Ker G. We have
ðx þ y; x  2y; 3x þ yÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ

or

x þ y ¼ 0; x  2y ¼ 0; 3x þ y ¼ 0

The only solution is x ¼ 0, y ¼ 0; hence, G is nonsingular.
(b) Although G is nonsingular, it is not invertible, because R2 and R3 have different dimensions. (Thus,
Theorem 5.9 does not apply.) Accordingly, G1 does not exist.

185

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

5.27. Suppose that F : V ! U is linear and that V is of ﬁnite dimension. Show that V and the image of
F have the same dimension if and only if F is nonsingular. Determine all nonsingular linear
mappings T : R4 ! R3 .
By Theorem 5.6, dim V ¼ dimðIm FÞ þ dimðKer FÞ. Hence, V and Im F have the same dimension if
and only if dimðKer FÞ ¼ 0 or Ker F ¼ f0g (i.e., if and only if F is nonsingular).
Because dim R3 is less than dim R4 , we have that dimðIm T Þ is less than the dimension of the domain
4
R of T . Accordingly no linear mapping T : R4 ! R3 can be nonsingular.

5.28. Prove Theorem 5.7: Let F : V ! U be a nonsingular linear mapping. Then the image of any
linearly independent set is linearly independent.
Suppose v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are linearly independent vectors in V. We claim that Fðv 1 Þ; Fðv 2 Þ; . . . ; Fðv n Þ are
also linearly independent. Suppose a1 Fðv 1 Þ þ a2 Fðv 2 Þ þ    þ an Fðv n Þ ¼ 0, where ai 2 K. Because F is
linear, Fða1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n Þ ¼ 0. Hence,
a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n 2 Ker F
But F is nonsingular—that is, Ker F ¼ f0g. Hence, a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n ¼ 0. Because the v i are
linearly independent, all the ai are 0. Accordingly, the Fðv i Þ are linearly independent. Thus, the theorem is
proved.

5.29. Prove Theorem 5.9: Suppose V has ﬁnite dimension and dim V ¼ dim U. Suppose F : V ! U is
linear. Then F is an isomorphism if and only if F is nonsingular.
If F is an isomorphism, then only 0 maps to 0; hence, F is nonsingular. Conversely, suppose F is
nonsingular. Then dimðKer FÞ ¼ 0. By Theorem 5.6, dim V ¼ dimðKer FÞ þ dimðIm FÞ. Thus,
dim U ¼ dim V ¼ dimðIm FÞ
Because U has ﬁnite dimension, Im F ¼ U . This means F maps V onto U. Thus, F is one-to-one and onto;
that is, F is an isomorphism.

Operations with Linear Maps
5.30. Deﬁne F : R3 ! R2 and G : R3 ! R2 by Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2x; y þ zÞ and Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx  z; yÞ.
Find formulas deﬁning the maps: (a) F þ G, (b) 3F, (c) 2F  5G.

5.31. Let F : R3 ! R2 and G : R2 ! R2 be deﬁned by Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2x; y þ zÞ and Gðx; yÞ ¼ ðy; xÞ.
Derive formulas deﬁning the mappings: (a) G  F, (b) F  G.
(a) ðG  FÞðx; y; zÞ ¼ GðFðx; y; zÞÞ ¼ Gð2x; y þ zÞ ¼ ðy þ z; 2xÞ
(b) The mapping F  G is not deﬁned, because the image of G is not contained in the domain of F.

5.32. Prove: (a) The zero mapping 0, deﬁned by 0ðvÞ ¼ 0 2 U for every v 2 V , is the zero element of
HomðV ; U Þ. (b) The negative of F 2 HomðV ; U Þ is the mapping ð1ÞF, that is, F ¼ ð1ÞF.
Let F 2 HomðV ; U Þ. Then, for every v 2 V :
ðaÞ

ðF þ 0ÞðvÞ ¼ FðvÞ þ 0ðvÞ ¼ FðvÞ þ 0 ¼ FðvÞ

Because ðF þ 0ÞðvÞ ¼ FðvÞ for every v 2 V , we have F þ 0 ¼ F. Similarly, 0 þ F ¼ F:
ðbÞ

ðF þ ð1ÞFÞðvÞ ¼ FðvÞ þ ð1ÞFðvÞ ¼ FðvÞ  FðvÞ ¼ 0 ¼ 0ðvÞ

Thus, F þ ð1ÞF ¼ 0: Similarly ð1ÞF þ F ¼ 0: Hence, F ¼ ð1ÞF:

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

5.33. Suppose F1 ; F2 ; . . . ; Fn are linear maps from V into U . Show that, for any scalars a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an ,
and for any v 2 V ,
ða1 F1 þ a2 F2 þ    þ an Fn ÞðvÞ ¼ a1 F1 ðvÞ þ a2 F2 ðvÞ þ    þ an Fn ðvÞ
The mapping a1 F1 is deﬁned by ða1 F1 ÞðvÞ ¼ a1 FðvÞ. Hence, the theorem holds for n ¼ 1. Accordingly,
by induction,
ða1 F1 þ a2 F2 þ    þ an Fn ÞðvÞ ¼ ða1 F1 ÞðvÞ þ ða2 F2 þ    þ an Fn ÞðvÞ
¼ a1 F1 ðvÞ þ a2 F2 ðvÞ þ    þ an Fn ðvÞ

5.34. Consider linear mappings F : R3 ! R2 , G : R3 ! R2 , H : R3 ! R2 deﬁned by
Fðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx þ y þ z; x þ yÞ;

Gðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2x þ z; x þ yÞ;

Hðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2y; xÞ

Show that F, G, H are linearly independent [as elements of HomðR ; R Þ].

Suppose, for scalars a; b; c 2 K,
aF þ bG þ cH ¼ 0

ð1Þ

(Here 0 is the zero mapping.) For e1 ¼ ð1; 0; 0Þ 2 R , we have 0ðe1 Þ ¼ ð0; 0Þ and
3

ðaF þ bG þ cHÞðe1 Þ ¼ aFð1; 0; 0Þ þ bGð1; 0; 0Þ þ cHð1; 0; 0Þ
¼ að1; 1Þ þ bð2; 1Þ þ cð0; 1Þ ¼ ða þ 2b;
Thus by (1), ða þ 2b;

a þ b þ cÞ

a þ b þ cÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ and so
a þ 2b ¼ 0

and

aþbþc¼0

ð2Þ

Similarly for e2 ¼ ð0; 1; 0Þ 2 R3 , we have 0ðe2 Þ ¼ ð0; 0Þ and
ðaF þ bG þ cHÞðe2 Þ ¼ aFð0; 1; 0Þ þ bGð0; 1; 0Þ þ cHð0; 1; 0Þ
¼ að1; 1Þ þ bð0; 1Þ þ cð2; 0Þ ¼ ða þ 2c;
Thus,

a þ 2c ¼ 0

and

a ¼ 0;

b ¼ 0;

a þ bÞ

ð4Þ

Using (2) and (3), we obtain

Because (1) implies (4), the mappings F, G, H are linearly independent.

5.35. Let k be a nonzero scalar. Show that a linear map T is singular if and only if kT is singular. Hence,
T is singular if and only if T is singular.
Suppose T is singular. Then T ðvÞ ¼ 0 for some vector v 6¼ 0. Hence,
ðkT ÞðvÞ ¼ kT ðvÞ ¼ k0 ¼ 0
and so kT is singular.
Now suppose kT is singular. Then ðkT ÞðwÞ ¼ 0 for some vector w 6¼ 0. Hence,
T ðkwÞ ¼ kT ðwÞ ¼ ðkT ÞðwÞ ¼ 0
But k 6¼ 0 and w 6¼ 0 implies kw 6¼ 0. Thus, T is also singular.

5.36. Find the dimension d of:
(a) HomðR3 ; R4 Þ, (b) HomðR5 ; R3 Þ, (c) HomðP3 ðtÞ; R2 Þ, (d) HomðM2;3 ; R4 Þ.
Use dim½HomðV; U Þ ¼ mn, where dim V ¼ m and dim U ¼ n.
(a) d ¼ 3ð4Þ ¼ 12.
(b) d ¼ 5ð3Þ ¼ 15.

(c) Because dim P3 ðtÞ ¼ 4, d ¼ 4ð2Þ ¼ 8.
(d) Because dim M2;3 ¼ 6, d ¼ 6ð4Þ ¼ 24.

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings
5.37. Prove Theorem 5.11. Suppose dim V ¼ m and dim U ¼ n. Then dim½HomðV ; U Þ ¼ mn.

Suppose fv 1 ; . . . ; v m g is a basis of V and fu1 ; . . . ; un g is a basis of U. By Theorem 5.2, a linear mapping
in HomðV; U Þ is uniquely determined by arbitrarily assigning elements of U to the basis elements v i of V. We
deﬁne
Fij 2 HomðV; U Þ;

i ¼ 1; . . . ; m;

j ¼ 1; . . . ; n

to be the linear mapping for which Fij ðv i Þ ¼ uj , and Fij ðv k Þ ¼ 0 for k 6¼ i. That is, Fij maps v i into uj and the
other v’s into 0. Observe that fFij g contains exactly mn elements; hence, the theorem is proved if we show
that it is a basis of HomðV; U Þ.
Proof that fFij g generates HomðV; U Þ. Consider an arbitrary function F 2 HomðV; U Þ. Suppose
Fðv 1 Þ ¼ w1 ; Fðv 2 Þ ¼ w2 ; . . . ; Fðv m Þ ¼ wm . Because wk 2 U , it is a linear combination of the u’s; say,
wk ¼ ak1 u1 þ ak2 u2 þ    þ akn un ;
k ¼ 1; . . . ; m; aij 2 K
ð1Þ
Pm Pn
Consider the linear mapping G ¼ i¼1
j¼1 aij Fij . Because G is a linear combination of the Fij , the proof
that fFij g generates HomðV; U Þ is complete if we show that F ¼ G.
We now compute Gðv k Þ; k ¼ 1; . . . ; m. Because Fij ðv k Þ ¼ 0 for k 6¼ i and Fki ðv k Þ ¼ ui ;
Gðv k Þ ¼

Thus, by (1), Gðv k Þ ¼ wk for each k. But Fðv k Þ ¼ wk for each k. Accordingly, by Theorem 5.2, F ¼ G;
hence, fFij g generates HomðV; U Þ.
Proof that fFij g is linearly independent. Suppose, for scalars cij 2 K,

cij Fij ¼ 0

But the ui are linearly independent; hence, for k ¼ 1; . . . ; m, we have ck1 ¼ 0; ck2 ¼ 0; . . . ; ckn ¼ 0. In other
words, all the cij ¼ 0, and so fFij g is linearly independent.

5.38. Prove Theorem 5.12: (i) G  ðF þ F 0 Þ ¼ G  F þ G  F 0 . (ii) ðG þ G0 Þ  F ¼ G  F þ G0  F.
(iii) kðG  FÞ ¼ ðkGÞ  F ¼ G  ðkFÞ.
(i) For every v 2 V ,
ðG  ðF þ F 0 ÞÞðvÞ ¼ GððF þ F 0 ÞðvÞÞ ¼ GðFðvÞ þ F 0 ðvÞÞ

Thus, ðG þ G0 Þ  F ¼ G  F þ G0  F.

Accordingly, kðG  FÞ ¼ ðkGÞ  F ¼ G  ðkFÞ. (We emphasize that two mappings are shown to be equal
by showing that each of them assigns the same image to each point in the domain.)

Algebra of Linear Maps
5.39. Let F and G be the linear operators on R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ðy; xÞ and Gðx; yÞ ¼ ð0; xÞ. Find
formulas deﬁning the following operators:
(a) F þ G, (b) 2F  3G, (c) FG, (d) GF, (e) F 2 , (f ) G2 .
(a) ðF þ GÞðx; yÞ ¼ Fðx; yÞ þ Gðx; yÞ ¼ ðy; xÞ þ ð0; xÞ ¼ ðy; 2xÞ.
(b) ð2F  3GÞðx; yÞ ¼ 2Fðx; yÞ  3Gðx; yÞ ¼ 2ðy; xÞ  3ð0; xÞ ¼ ð2y; xÞ.
(c) ðFGÞðx; yÞ ¼ FðGðx; yÞÞ ¼ Fð0; xÞ ¼ ðx; 0Þ.
(d) ðGFÞðx; yÞ ¼ GðFðx; yÞÞ ¼ Gðy; xÞ ¼ ð0; yÞ.
(e) F 2 ðx; yÞ ¼ FðFðx; yÞÞ ¼ Fðy; xÞ ¼ ðx; yÞ. (Note that F 2 ¼ I, the identity mapping.)
(f ) G2 ðx; yÞ ¼ GðGðx; yÞÞ ¼ Gð0; xÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ. (Note that G2 ¼ 0, the zero mapping.)

5.40. Consider the linear operator T on R3 deﬁned by Tðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2x; 4x  y; 2x þ 3y  zÞ.
(a) Show that T is invertible. Find formulas for (b) T 1 , (c) T 2 , (d ) T 2 .
(a) Let W ¼ Ker T . We need only show that T is nonsingular (i.e., that W ¼ f0g). Set T ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ,
which yields
T ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2x; 4x  y; 2x þ 3y  zÞ ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ
Thus, W is the solution space of the homogeneous system
2x ¼ 0;

4x  y ¼ 0;

2x þ 3y  z ¼ 0

which has only the trivial solution (0, 0, 0). Thus, W ¼ f0g. Hence, T is nonsingular, and so T is
invertible.
(b) Set T ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðr; s; tÞ [and so T 1 ðr; s; tÞ ¼ ðx; y; zÞ]. We have
ð2x; 4x  y; 2x þ 3y  zÞ ¼ ðr; s; tÞ

or

2x ¼ r;

4x  y ¼ s;

2x þ 3y  z ¼ t

Solve for x, y, z in terms of r, s, t to get x ¼ 12 r, y ¼ 2r  s, z ¼ 7r  3s  t. Thus,
T 1 ðr; s; tÞ ¼ ð12 r; 2r  s; 7r  3s  tÞ

or

T 1 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð12 x; 2x  y; 7x  3y  zÞ

(c) Apply T twice to get
T 2 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ T ð2x; 4x  y; 2x þ 3y  zÞ
¼ ½4x; 4ð2xÞ  ð4x  yÞ; 2ð2xÞ þ 3ð4x  yÞ  ð2x þ 3y  zÞ

(d) Apply T 1 twice to get
T 2 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ T 2 ð12 x; 2x  y; 7x  3y  zÞ
¼ ½14 x; 2ð12 xÞ  ð2x  yÞ; 7ð12 xÞ  3ð2x  yÞ  ð7x  3y  zÞ

CHAPTER 5 Linear Mappings

5.41. Let V be of ﬁnite dimension and let T be a linear operator on V for which TR ¼ I, for some
operator R on V. (We call R a right inverse of T .)
(a) Show that T is invertible. (b) Show that R ¼ T 1 .
(c) Give an example showing that the above need not hold if V is of inﬁnite dimension.
(a) Let dim V ¼ n. By Theorem 5.14, T is invertible if and only if T is onto; hence, T is invertible if and
only if rankðT Þ ¼ n. We have n ¼ rankðIÞ ¼ rankðTRÞ  rankðT Þ  n. Hence, rankðT Þ ¼ n and T is
invertible.
(b) TT 1 ¼ T 1 T ¼ I. Then R ¼ IR ¼ ðT 1 T ÞR ¼ T 1 ðTRÞ ¼ T 1 I ¼ T 1 .
(c) Let V be the space of polynomials in t over K; say, pðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1 t þ a2 t2 þ    þ as ts . Let T and R be
the operators on V deﬁned by
T ð pðtÞÞ ¼ 0 þ a1 þ a2 t þ    þ as ts1

and

Rð pðtÞÞ ¼ a0 t þ a1 t2 þ    þ as tsþ1

We have
ðTRÞð pðtÞÞ ¼ T ðRð pðtÞÞÞ ¼ T ða0 t þ a1 t2 þ    þ as tsþ1 Þ ¼ a0 þ a1 t þ    þ as ts ¼ pðtÞ
and so TR ¼ I, the identity mapping. On the other hand, if k 2 K and k 6¼ 0, then
ðRT ÞðkÞ ¼ RðT ðkÞÞ ¼ Rð0Þ ¼ 0 6¼ k
Accordingly, RT 6¼ I.

5.42. Let F and G be linear operators on R2 deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð0; xÞ and Gðx; yÞ ¼ ðx; 0Þ. Show that
(a) GF ¼ 0, the zero mapping, but FG 6¼ 0. (b) G2 ¼ G.
(a) ðGFÞðx; yÞ ¼ GðFðx; yÞÞ ¼ Gð0; xÞ ¼ ð0; 0Þ. Because GF assigns 0 ¼ ð0; 0Þ to every vector (x; y) in R2 ,
it is the zero mapping; that is, GF ¼ 0.
On the other hand, ðFGÞðx; yÞ ¼ FðGðx; yÞÞ ¼ Fðx; 0Þ ¼ ð0; xÞ. For example, ðFGÞð2; 3Þ ¼ ð0; 2Þ.
Thus, FG 6¼ 0, as it does not assign 0 ¼ ð0; 0Þ to every vector in R2 .
(b) For any vector (x; y) in R2 , we have G2 ðx; yÞ ¼ GðGðx; yÞÞ ¼ Gðx; 0Þ ¼ ðx; 0Þ ¼ Gðx; yÞ. Hence, G2 ¼ G.

5.43. Find the dimension of (a) AðR4 Þ, (b) AðP2 ðtÞÞ, (c) AðM2;3 ).
Use dim½AðV Þ ¼ n2 where dim V ¼ n. Hence, (a) dim½AðR4 Þ ¼ 42 ¼ 16, (b) dim½AðP2 ðtÞÞ ¼ 32 ¼ 9,
(c) dim½AðM2;3 Þ ¼ 62 ¼ 36.

5.44. Let E be a linear operator on V for which E2 ¼ E. (Such an operator is called a projection.) Let U
be the image of E, and let W be the kernel. Prove
(a)

If u 2 U, then EðuÞ ¼ u (i.e., E is the identity mapping on U ).

(b)

If E 6¼ I, then E is singular—that is, EðvÞ ¼ 0 for some v 6¼ 0.

(c)

V ¼U

W.

(a) If u 2 U, the image of E, then EðvÞ ¼ u for some v 2 V. Hence, using E2 ¼ E, we have
u ¼ EðvÞ ¼ E2 ðvÞ ¼ EðEðvÞÞ ¼ EðuÞ
(b) If E 6¼ I, then for some v 2 V, EðvÞ ¼ u, where v 6¼ u. By (i), EðuÞ ¼ u. Thus,
Eðv  uÞ ¼ EðvÞ  EðuÞ ¼ u  u ¼ 0;

where

v  u 6¼ 0

(c) We ﬁrst show that V ¼ U þ W. Let v 2 V. Set u ¼ EðvÞ and w ¼ v  EðvÞ. Then
v ¼ EðvÞ þ v  EðvÞ ¼ u þ w
By deﬂnition, u ¼ EðvÞ 2 U, the image of E. We now show that w 2 W, the kernel of E,
EðwÞ ¼ Eðv  EðvÞÞ ¼ EðvÞ  E2 ðvÞ ¼ EðvÞ  EðvÞ ¼ 0
and thus w 2 W. Hence, V ¼ U þ W.
We next show that U \ W ¼ f0g. Let v 2 U \ W. Because v 2 U, EðvÞ ¼ v by part (a). Because
v 2 W, EðvÞ ¼ 0. Thus, v ¼ EðvÞ ¼ 0 and so U \ W ¼ f0g.
The above two properties imply that V ¼ U W.

Linear Mappings
and Matrices

Introduction

Consider a basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of a vector space V over a ﬁeld K. For any vector v 2 V , suppose
v ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un
Then the coordinate vector of v relative to the basis S, which we assume to be a column vector (unless
otherwise stated or implied), is denoted and deﬁned by
½vS ¼ ½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an T
Recall (Section 4.11) that the mapping v7!½vS , determined by the basis S, is an isomorphism between V
and K n .
This chapter shows that there is also an isomorphism, determined by the basis S, between the algebra
AðV Þ of linear operators on V and the algebra M of n-square matrices over K. Thus, every linear mapping
F: V ! V will correspond to an n-square matrix ½FS determined by the basis S. We will also show how
our matrix representation changes when we choose another basis.

6.2

Matrix Representation of a Linear Operator

Let T be a linear operator (transformation) from a vector space V into itself, and suppose
S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is a basis of V . Now T ðu1 Þ, T ðu2 Þ; . . . ; T ðun Þ are vectors in V , and so each is a
linear combination of the vectors in the basis S; say,
T ðu1 Þ ¼ a11 u1 þ a12 u2 þ    þ a1n un
T ðu2 Þ ¼ a21 u1 þ a22 u2 þ    þ a2n un
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
T ðun Þ ¼ an1 u1 þ an2 u2 þ    þ ann un
The following deﬁnition applies.
The transpose of the above matrix of coefﬁcients, denoted by mS ðT Þ or ½T S , is called
the matrix representation of T relative to the basis S, or simply the matrix of T in the
basis S. (The subscript S may be omitted if the basis S is understood.)
Using the coordinate (column) vector notation, the matrix representation of T may be written in the
form


mS ðT Þ ¼ ½T S ¼ ½T ðu1 ÞS ; ½T ðu2 ÞS ; . . . ; ½T ðu1 ÞS
DEFINITION:

That is, the columns of mðT Þ are the coordinate vectors of T ðu1 Þ, T ðu2 Þ; . . . ; T ðun Þ, respectively.

EXAMPLE 6.1

Let F: R2 ! R2 be the linear operator deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x þ 3y; 4x  5yÞ.

(a) Find the matrix representation of F relative to the basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 g ¼ fð1; 2Þ; ð2; 5Þg.
(1) First ﬁnd Fðu1 Þ, and then write it as a linear combination of the basis vectors u1 and u2 . (For notational

Solve the system to obtain x ¼ 52, y ¼ 22. Hence, Fðu1 Þ ¼ 52u1  22u2 .

Solve the system to get x ¼ 129, y ¼ 55. Thus, Fðu2 Þ ¼ 129u1  55u2 .
Now write the coordinates of Fðu1 Þ and Fðu2 Þ as columns to obtain the matrix

(b) Find the matrix representation of F relative to the (usual) basis E ¼ fe1 ; e2 g ¼ fð1; 0Þ; ð0; 1Þg.
Find Fðe1 Þ and write it as a linear combination of the usual basis vectors e1 and e2 , and then ﬁnd Fðe2 Þ and
write it as a linear combination of e1 and e2 . We have



Fðe1 Þ ¼ Fð1; 0Þ ¼ ð2; 2Þ ¼ 2e1 þ 4e2

Note that the coordinates of Fðe1 Þ and Fðe2 Þ form the columns, not the rows, of ½FE . Also, note that the
arithmetic is much simpler using the usual basis of R2 .

Let V be the vector space of functions with basis S ¼ fsin t; cos t; e3t g, and let D: V ! V
be the differential operator deﬁned by Dð f ðtÞÞ ¼ dð f ðtÞÞ=dt. We compute the matrix representing D in
the basis S:

Solving the system yields x ¼ 6, y ¼ 1. Thus, Aðu2 Þ ¼ 6u1 þ u2 . Writing the coordinates of
Aðu1 Þ and Aðu2 Þ as columns gives us the following matrix representation of A:

usual basis E of K n is the matrix A itself ; that is;
½AE ¼ A

Algorithm for Finding Matrix Representations
Next follows an algorithm for ﬁnding matrix representations. The ﬁrst Step 0 is optional. It may be useful
to use it in Step 1(b), which is repeated for each basis vector.
ALGORITHM 6.1:

The input is a linear operator T on a vector space V and a basis
S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of V . The output is the matrix representation ½T S .

Step 0. Find a formula for the coordinates of an arbitrary vector v relative to the basis S.
Step 1. Repeat for each basis vector uk in S:
(a) Find T ðuk Þ.
(b) Write Tðuk Þ as a linear combination of the basis vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un .
Step 2. Form the matrix ½T S whose columns are the coordinate vectors in Step 1(b).
Let F: R2 ! R2 be deﬁned by Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x þ 3y; 4x  5yÞ. Find the matrix representation ½FS of F relative to the basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 g ¼ fð1; 2Þ; ð2; 5Þg.

CHAPTER 6 Linear Mappings and Matrices
Solving for x and y in terms of a and b yields x ¼ 5a þ 2b, y ¼ 2a  b. Thus,
ða; bÞ ¼ ð5a þ 2bÞu1 þ ð2a  bÞu2

(Step 1) Now we ﬁnd Fðu1 Þ and write it as a linear combination of u1 and u2 using the above formula for ða; bÞ,
and then we repeat the process for Fðu2 Þ. We have

Fðu1 Þ ¼ Fð1; 2Þ ¼ ð4; 14Þ ¼ 8u1  6u2
Fðu2 Þ ¼ Fð2; 5Þ ¼ ð11; 33Þ ¼ 11u1  11u2
(Step 2) Finally, we write the coordinates of Fðu1 Þ and Fðu2 Þ as columns to obtain the required matrix:

Properties of Matrix Representations
This subsection gives the main properties of the matrix representations of linear operators T on a vector
space V . We emphasize that we are always given a particular basis S of V .
Our ﬁrst theorem, proved in Problem 6.9, tells us that the ‘‘action’’ of a linear operator T on a vector v
is preserved by its matrix representation.
THEOREM 6.1:

EXAMPLE 6.4

Let T : V ! V be a linear operator, and let S be a (ﬁnite) basis of V . Then, for any
vector v in V , ½T S ½vS ¼ ½T ðvÞS .

Consider the linear operator F on R2 and the basis S of Example 6.3; that is,

Fðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x þ 3y;

4x  5yÞ

and

S ¼ fu1 ; u2 g ¼ fð1; 2Þ;

ð2; 5Þg

Let
v ¼ ð5; 7Þ;

and so

FðvÞ ¼ ð11; 55Þ

Using the formula from Example 6.3, we get

½v ¼ ½11; 3T

and

½FðvÞ ¼ ½55; 33T

We verify Theorem 6.1 for this vector v (where ½F is obtained from Example 6.3):

Given a basis S of a vector space V , we have associated a matrix ½T  to each linear operator T in the
algebra AðV Þ of linear operators on V . Theorem 6.1 tells us that the ‘‘action’’ of an individual linear
operator T is preserved by this representation. The next two theorems (proved in Problems 6.10 and 6.11)
tell us that the three basic operations in AðV Þ with these operators—namely (i) addition, (ii) scalar
multiplication, and (iii) composition—are also preserved.
THEOREM 6.2:

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over K, let S be a basis of V , and let M be
the algebra of n n matrices over K. Then the mapping
m: AðV Þ ! M

defined by

mðT Þ ¼ ½T S

is a vector space isomorphism. That is, for any F; G 2 AðV Þ and any k 2 K,
(i) mðF þ GÞ ¼ mðFÞ þ mðGÞ or ½F þ G ¼ ½F þ ½G
(ii) mðkFÞ ¼ kmðFÞ or ½kF ¼ k½F
(iii) m is bijective (one-to-one and onto).

For any linear operators F; G 2 AðV Þ,

(Here G  F denotes the composition of the maps G and F.)

Change of Basis

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld K. We have shown that once we have selected a basis
S of V , every vector v 2 V can be represented by means of an n-tuple ½vS in K n , and every linear operator
T in AðV Þ can be represented by an n n matrix over K. We ask the following natural question:
How do our representations change if we select another basis?
In order to answer this question, we ﬁrst need a deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

Let S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g be a basis of a vector space V; and let S 0 ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g
be another basis. (For reference, we will call S the ‘‘old’’ basis and S 0 the ‘‘new’’
basis.) Because S is a basis, each vector in the ‘‘new’’ basis S 0 can be written uniquely
as a linear combination of the vectors in S; say,
v 1 ¼ a11 u1 þ a12 u2 þ    þ a1n un
v 2 ¼ a21 u1 þ a22 u2 þ    þ a2n un
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
v n ¼ an1 u1 þ an2 u2 þ    þ ann un
Let P be the transpose of the above matrix of coefﬁcients; that is, let P ¼ ½pij , where
pij ¼ aji . Then P is called the change-of-basis matrix (or transition matrix) from the
‘‘old’’ basis S to the ‘‘new’’ basis S 0 .

The following remarks are in order.
Remark 1: The above change-of-basis matrix P may also be viewed as the matrix whose columns
are, respectively, the coordinate column vectors of the ‘‘new’’ basis vectors v i relative to the ‘‘old’’ basis
S; namely,


P ¼ ½v 1 S ; ½v 2 S ; . . . ; ½v n S
Remark 2: Analogously, there is a change-of-basis matrix Q from the ‘‘new’’ basis S 0 to the
‘‘old’’ basis S. Similarly, Q may be viewed as the matrix whose columns are, respectively, the coordinate
column vectors of the ‘‘old’’ basis vectors ui relative to the ‘‘new’’ basis S 0 ; namely,


Q ¼ ½u1 S 0 ; ½u2 S 0 ; . . . ; ½un S 0
Remark 3: Because the vectors v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n in the new basis S 0 are linearly independent, the
matrix P is invertible (Problem 6.18). Similarly, Q is invertible. In fact, we have the following
proposition (proved in Problem 6.18).
PROPOSITION 6.4:

Let P and Q be the above change-of-basis matrices. Then Q ¼ P1 .

Now suppose S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is a basis of a vector space V , and suppose P ¼ ½pij  is any
nonsingular matrix. Then the n vectors
v i ¼ p1i ui þ p2i u2 þ    þ pni un ;

i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n

corresponding to the columns of P, are linearly independent [Problem 6.21(a)]. Thus, they form another
basis S 0 of V . Moreover, P will be the change-of-basis matrix from S to the new basis S 0 .

and

(a) Find the change-of-basis matrix P from S to the ‘‘new’’ basis S 0 .
Write each of the new basis vectors of S 0 as a linear combination of the original basis vectors u1 and u2 of

Note that the coordinates of v 1 and v 2 are the columns, not rows, of the change-of-basis matrix P.
(b) Find the change-of-basis matrix Q from the ‘‘new’’ basis S 0 back to the ‘‘old’’ basis S.
Here we write each of the ‘‘old’’ basis vectors u1 and u2 of S 0 as a linear combination of the ‘‘new’’ basis

Again, the coordinates of u1 ; u2 ; u3 appear as the columns in P. Observe that P is simply the matrix whose
columns are the basis vectors of S. This is true only because the original basis was the usual basis E.
(b) Find the change-of-basis matrix Q from the basis S to the basis E.
The deﬁnition of the change-of-basis matrix Q tells us to write each of the (usual) basis vectors in E as a
linear combination of the basis elements of S. This yields

e1 ¼ ð1; 0; 0Þ ¼ 2u1 þ 2u2  u3
e2 ¼ ð0; 1; 0Þ ¼ 2u1 þ u2

(Here we have used the fact that Q is the inverse of P.)

The result in Example 6.6(a) is true in general. We state this result formally, because it occurs often.
PROPOSITION 6.5:

The change-of-basis matrix from the usual basis E of K n to any basis S of K n is
the matrix P whose columns are, respectively, the basis vectors of S.

Applications of Change-of-Basis Matrix
First we show how a change of basis affects the coordinates of a vector in a vector space V . The
following theorem is proved in Problem 6.22.
THEOREM 6.6:

Let P be the change-of-basis matrix from a basis S to a basis S 0 in a vector space V .
Then, for any vector v 2 V , we have
P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS

and hence;

P1 ½vS ¼ ½vS 0

Namely, if we multiply the coordinates of v in the original basis S by P1 , we get the coordinates of v
in the new basis S 0 .
Remark 1: Although P is called the change-of-basis matrix from the old basis S to the new basis
S 0 , we emphasize that P1 transforms the coordinates of v in the original basis S into the coordinates of v
in the new basis S 0 .
Remark 2: Because of the above theorem, many texts call Q ¼ P1 , not P, the transition matrix
from the old basis S to the new basis S 0 . Some texts also refer to Q as the change-of-coordinates matrix.
We now give the proof of the above theorem for the special case that dim V ¼ 3. Suppose P is the
change-of-basis matrix from the basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; u3 g to the basis S 0 ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; v 3 g; say,
v 1 ¼ a1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ a3 a3
v 2 ¼ b1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ b3 u3
v 3 ¼ c1 u1 þ c2 u2 þ c3 u3

2

and hence;

a1
P ¼ 4 a2
a3

b1

Now suppose v 2 V and, say, v ¼ k1 v 1 þ k2 v 2 þ k3 v 3 . Then, substituting for v 1 ; v 2 ; v 3 from above, we
obtain
v ¼ k1 ða1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ a3 u3 Þ þ k2 ðb1 u1 þ b2 u2 þ b3 u3 Þ þ k3 ðc1 u1 þ c2 u2 þ c3 u3 Þ

Thus,

Finally, multiplying the equation ½vS ¼ P½vS , by P1 , we get
P1 ½vS ¼ P1 P½vS 0 ¼ I½vS 0 ¼ ½vS 0
The next theorem (proved in Problem 6.26) shows how a change of basis affects the matrix
representation of a linear operator.
THEOREM 6.7:

Let P be the change-of-basis matrix from a basis S to a basis S 0 in a vector space V .
Then, for any linear operator T on V ,
½T S 0 ¼ P1 ½T S P
That is, if A and B are the matrix representations of T relative, respectively, to S and
S 0 , then
B ¼ P1 AP

Consider the following two bases of R3 :

and

E ¼ fe1 ; e2 ; e3 g ¼ fð1; 0; 0Þ;

ð2; 1; 2Þ;

ð1; 2; 2Þg

The change-of-basis matrix P from E to S and its inverse P1 were obtained in Example 6.6.
(a) Write v ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 , or, equivalently, ﬁnd ½vS .
One way to do this is to directly solve the vector equation v ¼ xu1 þ yu2 þ zu3 ; that is,

or

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 1
y þ 2z ¼ 3
x þ 2y þ 2z ¼ 5

The solution is x ¼ 7, y ¼ 5, z ¼ 4, so v ¼ 7u1  5u2 þ 4u3 .
On the other hand, we know that ½vE ¼ ½1; 3; 5T , because E is the usual basis, and we already know P1 .
Therefore, by Theorem 6.6,

CHAPTER 6 Linear Mappings and Matrices

The deﬁnition of the matrix representation of A relative to the basis S tells us to write each of Aðu1 Þ, Aðu2 Þ,
Aðu3 Þ as a linear combination of the basis vectors u1 ; u2 ; u3 of S. This yields

Aðu1 Þ ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ ¼ 11u1  5u2 þ 6u3
Aðu2 Þ ¼ ð1; 2; 9Þ ¼ 21u1  14u2 þ 8u3
Aðu3 Þ ¼ ð3; 4; 5Þ ¼ 17u1  8e2 þ 2u3

and hence;

We emphasize that to ﬁnd B, we need to solve three 3 3 systems of linear equations—one 3
each of Aðu1 Þ, Aðu2 Þ, Aðu3 Þ.
On the other hand, because we know P and P1 , we can use Theorem 6.7. That is,

This, as expected, gives the same result.

6.4

Similarity

Suppose A and B are square matrices for which there exists an invertible matrix P such that B ¼ P1 AP;
then B is said to be similar to A, or B is said to be obtained from A by a similarity transformation. We
show (Problem 6.29) that similarity of matrices is an equivalence relation.
By Theorem 6.7 and the above remark, we have the following basic result.
THEOREM 6.8:

Two matrices represent the same linear operator if and only if the matrices are
similar.

That is, all the matrix representations of a linear operator T form an equivalence class of similar
matrices.
A linear operator T is said to be diagonalizable if there exists a basis S of V such that T is represented
by a diagonal matrix; the basis S is then said to diagonalize T. The preceding theorem gives us the
following result.
THEOREM 6.9:

Let A be the matrix representation of a linear operator T . Then T is diagonalizable
if and only if there exists an invertible matrix P such that P1 AP is a diagonal
matrix.

That is, T is diagonalizable if and only if its matrix representation can be diagonalized by a similarity
transformation.
We emphasize that not every operator is diagonalizable. However, we will show (Chapter 10) that
every linear operator can be represented by certain ‘‘standard’’ matrices called its normal or canonical
forms. Such a discussion will require some theory of ﬁelds, polynomials, and determinants.

Functions and Similar Matrices
Suppose f is a function on square matrices that assigns the same value to similar matrices; that is,
f ðAÞ ¼ f ðBÞ whenever A is similar to B. Then f induces a function, also denoted by f , on linear operators
T in the following natural way. We deﬁne
f ðT Þ ¼ f ð½T S Þ
where S is any basis. By Theorem 6.8, the function is well deﬁned.
The determinant (Chapter 8) is perhaps the most important example of such a function. The trace
(Section 2.7) is another important example of such a function.

S ¼ fð1; 2Þ; ð2; 5Þg

By Example 6.1, the matrix representations of F relative to the bases E and S are, respectively,

Trace of F ¼ trðAÞ ¼ 2  5 ¼ 3:

On the other hand, using matrix B, we have
(i) Determinant of F ¼ detðBÞ ¼ 2860 þ 2838 ¼ 22;

(ii)

Trace of F ¼ trðBÞ ¼ 52  55 ¼ 3.

As expected, both matrices yield the same result.

6.5

Matrices and General Linear Mappings

Last, we consider the general case of linear mappings from one vector space into another. Suppose V and
U are vector spaces over the same ﬁeld K and, say, dim V ¼ m and dim U ¼ n. Furthermore, suppose
S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m g

and

S 0 ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g

are arbitrary but ﬁxed bases, respectively, of V and U .
Suppose F: V ! U is a linear mapping. Then the vectors Fðv 1 Þ, Fðv 2 Þ; . . . ; Fðv m Þ belong to U ,
and so each is a linear combination of the basis vectors in S 0 ; say,
Fðv 1 Þ ¼ a11 u1 þ a12 u2 þ    þ a1n un
Fðv 2 Þ ¼ a21 u1 þ a22 u2 þ    þ a2n un
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Fðv m Þ ¼ am1 u1 þ am2 u2 þ    þ amn un
DEFINITION:

The transpose of the above matrix of coefﬁcients, denoted by mS;S 0 ðFÞ or ½FS;S 0 , is
called the matrix representation of F relative to the bases S and S 0 . [We will use the
simple notation mðFÞ and ½F when the bases are understood.]

The following theorem is analogous to Theorem 6.1 for linear operators (Problem 6.67).
THEOREM 6.10:

For any vector v 2 V , ½FS;S 0 ½vS ¼ ½FðvÞS 0 .

That is, multiplying the coordinates of v in the basis S of V by ½F, we obtain the coordinates of FðvÞ
in the basis S 0 of U .
Recall that for any vector spaces V and U , the collection of all linear mappings from V into U is a
vector space and is denoted by HomðV ; U Þ. The following theorem is analogous to Theorem 6.2 for linear
operators, where now we let M ¼ Mm;n denote the vector space of all m n matrices (Problem 6.67).
THEOREM 6.11:

The mapping m: HomðV ; U Þ ! M deﬁned by mðFÞ ¼ ½F is a vector space
isomorphism. That is, for any F; G 2 HomðV ; U Þ and any scalar k,
(i) mðF þ GÞ ¼ mðFÞ þ mðGÞ or ½F þ G ¼ ½F þ ½G
(ii) mðkFÞ ¼ kmðFÞ or ½kF ¼ k½F
(iii) m is bijective (one-to-one and onto).

205

CHAPTER 6 Linear Mappings and Matrices
Our next theorem is analogous to Theorem 6.3 for linear operators (Problem 6.67).
THEOREM 6.12:

Let S; S 0 ; S 00 be bases of vector spaces V ; U ; W , respectively. Let F: V ! U and
G  U ! W be linear mappings. Then
½G  FS;S 00 ¼ ½GS 0 ;S 00 ½FS;S 0

That is, relative to the appropriate bases, the matrix representation of the composition of two
mappings is the matrix product of the matrix representations of the individual mappings.
Next we show how the matrix representation of a linear mapping F: V ! U is affected when new
bases are selected (Problem 6.67).
THEOREM 6.13:

Let P be the change-of-basis matrix from a basis e to a basis e0 in V , and let Q be
the change-of-basis matrix from a basis f to a basis f 0 in U . Then, for any linear
map F: V ! U ,
½Fe0 ; f 0 ¼ Q1 ½Fe; f P

In other words, if A is the matrix representation of a linear mapping F relative to the bases e and f ,
and B is the matrix representation of F relative to the bases e0 and f 0 , then
B ¼ Q1 AP
Our last theorem, proved in Problem 6.36, shows that any linear mapping from one vector space V
into another vector space U can be represented by a very simple matrix. We note that this theorem is
analogous to Theorem 3.18 for m n matrices.
THEOREM 6.14:

Let F: V ! U be linear and, say, rankðFÞ ¼ r. Then there exist bases of V and U
such that the matrix representation of F has the form


Ir 0
A¼
0 0
where Ir is the r-square identity matrix.

The above matrix A is called the normal or canonical form of the linear map F.

CHAPTER 6 Linear Mappings and Matrices

(b) First ﬁnd Fðu1 Þ and write it as a linear combination of the basis vectors u1 and u2 . We have

x þ 2y ¼ 11

Solve the system to obtain x ¼ 49, y ¼ 30. Therefore,
Fðu1 Þ ¼ 49u1 þ 30u2
Next ﬁnd Fðu2 Þ and write it as a linear combination of the basis vectors u1 and u2 . We have

x þ 2y ¼ a

Let f be the mapping that sends an operator T into its matrix representation A. We need to prove that

fð f ðT ÞÞ ¼ fða0 I 0 Þ ¼ a0 fðI 0 Þ ¼ a0 I ¼ f ðAÞ

6.16. The vectors u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ, u2 ¼ ð0; 1; 1Þ, u3 ¼ ð1; 2; 2Þ form a basis S of R3 . Find the coordinates
of an arbitrary vector v ¼ ða; b; cÞ relative to the basis S.
Method 1. Express v as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 using unknowns x; y; z. We have
ða; b; cÞ ¼ xð1; 1; 0Þ þ yð0; 1; 1Þ þ zð1; 2; 2Þ ¼ ðx þ z; x þ y þ 2z; y þ 2zÞ
this yields the system

or

z¼a

y þ 2z ¼ c

Solving by back-substitution yields x ¼ b  c, y ¼ 2a þ 2b  c, z ¼ a  b þ c. Thus,
½vS ¼ ½b  c; 2a þ 2b  c; a  b þ cT
Method 2. Find P1 by row reducing M ¼ ½P; I to the form ½I; P1 , where P is the change-of-basis
matrix from the usual basis E to S or, in other words, the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors of S.

QP ¼ BT AT ¼ ðABÞT ¼ I T ¼ I
Thus, Q ¼ P1 .

6.19. Consider a ﬁnite sequence of vectors S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g. Let S 0 be the sequence of vectors
obtained from S by one of the following ‘‘elementary operations’’:
(1)
(2)
(3)

Interchange two vectors.
Multiply a vector by a nonzero scalar.
Add a multiple of one vector to another vector.

Show that S and S 0 span the same subspace W . Also, show that S 0 is linearly independent if and
only if S is linearly independent.

215

CHAPTER 6 Linear Mappings and Matrices

Observe that, for each operation, the vectors S 0 are linear combinations of vectors in S. Also, because
each operation has an inverse of the same type, each vector in S is a linear combination of vectors in S 0 .
Thus, S and S 0 span the same subspace W . Moreover, S 0 is linearly independent if and only if dim W ¼ n,
and this is true if and only if S is linearly independent.

6.20. Let A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  be row equivalent m n matrices over a ﬁeld K, and let v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n
be any vectors in a vector space V over K. For i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m, let ui and wi be deﬁned by
ui ¼ ai1 v 1 þ ai2 v 2 þ    þ ain v n

and

wi ¼ bi1 v 1 þ bi2 v 2 þ    þ bin v n

Show that fui g and fwi g span the same subspace of V .

Applying an ‘‘elementary operation’’ of Problem 6.19 to fui g is equivalent to applying an elementary
row operation to the matrix A. Because A and B are row equivalent, B can be obtained from A by a sequence
of elementary row operations. Hence, fwi g can be obtained from fui g by the corresponding sequence of
operations. Accordingly, fui g and fwi g span the same space.

6.21. Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un belong to a vector space V over a ﬁeld K, and suppose P ¼ ½aij  is an
n-square matrix over K. For i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n, let v i ¼ ai1 u1 þ ai2 u2 þ    þ ain un .
(a) Suppose P is invertible. Show that fui g and fv i g span the same subspace of V . Hence, fui g is
linearly independent if and only if fv i g is linearly independent.
(b) Suppose P is singular (not invertible). Show that fv i g is linearly dependent.
(c) Suppose fv i g is linearly independent. Show that P is invertible.
(a) Because P is invertible, it is row equivalent to the identity matrix I. Hence, by Problem 6.19, fv i g and
fui g span the same subspace of V . Thus, one is linearly independent if and only if the other is linearly
independent.
(b) Because P is not invertible, it is row equivalent to a matrix with a zero row. This means fv i g spans a
substance that has a spanning set with less than n elements. Thus, fv i g is linearly dependent.
(c) This is the contrapositive of the statement of part (b), and so it follows from part (b).

6.22. Prove Theorem 6.6: Let P be the change-of-basis matrix from a basis S to a basis S 0 in a vector
space V . Then, for any vector v 2 V , we have P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS , and hence, P1 ½vS ¼ ½vS 0 .
Suppose S ¼ fu1 ; . . . ; un g and S 0 ¼ fw1 ; . . . ; wn g, and suppose, for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n,
wi ¼ ai1 u1 þ ai2 u2 þ    þ ain un ¼

ð3Þ

On the other hand, the jth entry of P½vS 0 is obtained by multiplying the jth row of P by ½vS 0 —that is, (1) by
(2). However, the product of (1) and (2) is (3). Hence, P½vS 0 and ½vS have the same entries. Thus,
P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS 0 , as claimed.
Furthermore, multiplying the above by P1 gives P1 ½vS ¼ P1 P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS 0 .

(b) Find the matrix A that represents F in the basis E.

ða; bÞ ¼ xð1; 4Þ þ yð2; 7Þ ¼ ðx þ 2y; 4x þ 7yÞ;

x þ 2y ¼ a
4x þ 7y ¼ b

and so

Solve for x and y in terms of a and b to get x ¼ 7a þ 2b, y ¼ 4a  b. Then
ða; bÞ ¼ ð7a þ 2bÞu1 þ ð4a  bÞu2

Let v be a vector in V . Then, by Theorem 6.6, P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS . Therefore,

P1 ½T S P½vS 0 ¼ P1 ½T S ½vS ¼ P1 ½T ðvÞS ¼ ½T ðvÞS 0
But ½T S 0 ½vS 0 ¼ ½T ðvÞS 0 . Hence,

P1 ½T S P½vS 0 ¼ ½T S 0 ½vS 0

Because the mapping v 7! ½vS 0 is onto K n , we have P1 ½T S PX ¼ ½T S 0 X for every X 2 K n . Thus,
P1 ½T S P ¼ ½T S 0 , as claimed.

B ¼ PAP1 ¼ ðP1 Þ1 AP and P1 is also invertible. Thus, B A.

Inner Product Spaces,
Orthogonality
7.1

Introduction

The deﬁnition of a vector space V involves an arbitrary ﬁeld K. Here we ﬁrst restrict K to be the real ﬁeld
R, in which case V is called a real vector space; in the last sections of this chapter, we extend our results
to the case where K is the complex ﬁeld C, in which case V is called a complex vector space. Also, we
adopt the previous notation that
u; v; w

are vectors in V

a; b; c; k

are scalars in K

Furthermore, the vector spaces V in this chapter have ﬁnite dimension unless otherwise stated or implied.
Recall that the concepts of ‘‘length’’ and ‘‘orthogonality’’ did not appear in the investigation of
arbitrary vector spaces V (although they did appear in Section 1.4 on the spaces Rn and Cn ). Here we
place an additional structure on a vector space V to obtain an inner product space, and in this context
these concepts are deﬁned.

7.2

Inner Product Spaces

We begin with a deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

Let V be a real vector space. Suppose to each pair of vectors u; v 2 V there is assigned
a real number, denoted by hu; vi. This function is called a (real) inner product on V if it
satisﬁes the following axioms:
½I1  (Linear Property): hau1 þ bu2 ; vi ¼ ahu1 ; vi þ bhu2 ; vi.
½I2  (Symmetric Property): hu; vi ¼ hv; ui.
½I3  (Positive Deﬁnite Property): hu; ui  0.; and hu; ui ¼ 0 if and only if u ¼ 0.
The vector space V with an inner product is called a (real) inner product space.

Axiom ½I1  states that an inner product function is linear in the ﬁrst position. Using ½I1  and the
symmetry axiom ½I2 , we obtain
hu; cv 1 þ dv 2 i ¼ hcv 1 þ dv 2 ; ui ¼ chv 1 ; ui þ dhv 2 ; ui ¼ chu; v 1 i þ dhu; v 2 i
That is, the inner product function is also linear in its second position. Combining these two properties
and using induction yields the following general formula:

bj v j ¼
ai bj hui ; v j i

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

227

That is, an inner product of linear combinations of vectors is equal to a linear combination of the inner
products of the vectors.
EXAMPLE 7.1 Let V be a real inner product space. Then, by linearity,

h3u1  4u2 ; 2v 1  5v 2 þ 6v 3 i ¼ 6hu1 ; v 1 i  15hu1 ; v 2 i þ 18hu1 ; v 3 i
 8hu2 ; v 1 i þ 20hu2 ; v 2 i  24hu2 ; v 3 i
h2u  5v; 4u þ 6vi ¼ 8hu; ui þ 12hu; vi  20hv; ui  30hv; vi
¼ 8hu; ui  8hv; ui  30hv; vi
Observe that in the last equation we have used the symmetry property that hu; vi ¼ hv; ui.

Remark: Axiom ½I1  by itself implies h0; 0i ¼ h0v; 0i ¼ 0hv; 0i ¼ 0: Thus, ½I1 , ½I2 , ½I3  are
equivalent to ½I1 , ½I2 , and the following axiom:
½I03  If u 6¼ 0; then hu; ui is positive:
That is, a function satisfying ½I1 , ½I2 , ½I03  is an inner product.

Norm of a Vector
By the third axiom ½I3  of an inner product, hu; ui is nonnegative for any vector u. Thus, its positive square
root exists. We use the notation
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kuk ¼ hu; ui
This nonnegative number is called the norm or length of u. The relation kuk2 ¼ hu; ui will be used
frequently.
Remark: If kuk ¼ 1 or, equivalently, if hu; ui ¼ 1, then u is called a unit vector and it is said to be
normalized. Every nonzero vector v in V can be multiplied by the reciprocal of its length to obtain the
unit vector
v^ ¼

1
v
kvk

which is a positive multiple of v. This process is called normalizing v.

7.3

Examples of Inner Product Spaces

This section lists the main examples of inner product spaces used in this text.

Euclidean n-Space Rn
Consider the vector space Rn . The dot product or scalar product in Rn is deﬁned by
u  v ¼ a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ    þ an bn
where u ¼ ðai Þ and v ¼ ðbi Þ. This function deﬁnes an inner product on Rn . The norm kuk of the vector
u ¼ ðai Þ in this space is as follows:
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kuk ¼ u  u ¼ a21 þ a22 þ    þ a2n
On the other hand, bypthe
Pythagorean
theorem, the distance from the origin O in R3 to a point
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ﬃ
Pða; b; cÞ is given by a2 þ b2 þ c2 . This is precisely the same as the above-deﬁned norm of the
vector v ¼ ða; b; cÞ in R3 . Because the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the axioms of

228

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

Euclidean geometry, the vector space Rn with the above inner product and norm is called Euclidean
n-space. Although there are many ways to deﬁne an inner product on Rn , we shall assume this
inner product unless otherwise stated or implied. It is called the usual (or standard ) inner product
on Rn .
Remark: Frequently the vectors in Rn will be represented by column vectors—that is, by n
column matrices. In such a case, the formula

1

hu; vi ¼ uT v
deﬁnes the usual inner product on Rn .
EXAMPLE 7.2 Let u ¼ ð1; 3; 4; 2Þ, v ¼ ð4; 2; 2; 1Þ, w ¼ ð5; 1; 2; 6Þ in R4 .
(a) Show h3u  2v; wi ¼ 3hu; wi  2hv; wi:
By deﬁnition,

hu; wi ¼ 5  3 þ 8 þ 12 ¼ 22

and

hv; wi ¼ 20 þ 2  4 þ 6 ¼ 24

Note that 3u  2v ¼ ð5; 13; 16; 4Þ. Thus,

h3u  2v; wi ¼ 25  13 þ 32 þ 24 ¼ 18
As expected, 3hu; wi  2hv; wi ¼ 3ð22Þ  2ð24Þ ¼ 18 ¼ h3u  2v; wi.
(b) Normalize u and v:
By deﬁnition,

kuk ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1 þ 9 þ 16 þ 4 ¼ 30

and

kvk ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
16 þ 4 þ 4 þ 1 ¼ 5

We normalize u and v to obtain the following unit vectors in the directions of u and v, respectively:

Function Space C½a; b and Polynomial Space PðtÞ
The notation C½a; b is used to denote the vector space of all continuous functions on the closed interval
½a; b—that is, where a  t  b. The following deﬁnes an inner product on C½a; b, where f ðtÞ and gðtÞ
are functions in C½a; b:
ðb
h f ; gi ¼ f ðtÞgðtÞ dt
a

It is called the usual inner product on C½a; b.
The vector space PðtÞ of all polynomials is a subspace of C½a; b for any interval ½a; b, and hence, the
above is also an inner product on PðtÞ.
EXAMPLE 7.3
Consider f ðtÞ ¼ 3t  5 and gðtÞ ¼ t2 in the polynomial space PðtÞ with inner product

ð1

(b) Find k f k and kgk.
We have ½ f ðtÞ2 ¼ f ðtÞ f ðtÞ ¼ 9t2  30t þ 25 and ½gðtÞ2 ¼ t4 . Then

Therefore, k f k ¼ 13 and kgk ¼ 15 ¼ 15 5.

Matrix Space M ¼ Mm;n
Let M ¼ Mm;n , the vector space of all real m

n matrices. An inner product is deﬁned on M by

hA; Bi ¼ trðB AÞ
T

where, as usual, trð Þ is the trace—the sum of the diagonal elements. If A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij , then

hA; Bi ¼ trðBT AÞ ¼
aij bij
and
kAk2 ¼ hA; Ai ¼

i¼1 j¼1

i¼1 j¼1

That is, hA; Bi is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries in A and B and, in particular, hA; Ai
is the sum of the squares of the entries of A.

Hilbert Space
Let V be the vector space of all inﬁnite sequences of real numbers ða1 ; a2 ; a3 ; . . .Þ satisfying
1
P
a2i ¼ a21 þ a22 þ    < 1
i¼1

that is, the sum converges. Addition and scalar multiplication are deﬁned in V componentwise; that is, if
u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . .Þ
u þ v ¼ ða1 þ b1 ; a2 þ b2 ; . . .Þ

then

v ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; . . .Þ

and
and

ku ¼ ðka1 ; ka2 ; . . .Þ

An inner product is deﬁned in v by
hu; vi ¼ a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ   
The above sum converges absolutely for any pair of points in V. Hence, the inner product is well deﬁned.
This inner product space is called l2 -space or Hilbert space.

Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality, Applications

The following formula (proved in Problem 7.8) is called the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality or Schwarz
inequality. It is used in many branches of mathematics.
THEOREM 7.1:

(Cauchy–Schwarz) For any vectors u and v in an inner product space V,
hu; vi2  hu; uihv; vi

or

jhu; vij  kukkvk

Next we examine this inequality in speciﬁc cases.
EXAMPLE 7.4
(a) Consider any real numbers a1 ; . . . ; an , b1 ; . . . ; bn . Then, by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,

ða1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ    þ an bn Þ2  ða21 þ    þ a2n Þðb21 þ    þ b2n Þ
That is, ðu  vÞ2  kuk2 kvk2 , where u ¼ ðai Þ and v ¼ ðbi Þ.

That is, ðh f ; giÞ2  k f k2 kvk2 . Here V is the inner product space C½0; 1.

The next theorem (proved in Problem 7.9) gives the basic properties of a norm. The proof of the third
property requires the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
Let V be an inner product space. Then the norm in V satisﬁes the following
properties:

THEOREM 7.2:

½N1  kvk  0; and kvk ¼ 0 if and only if v ¼ 0.
½N2  kkvk ¼ jkjkvk.
½N3  ku þ vk  kuk þ kvk.
The property ½N3  is called the triangle inequality, because if we view u þ v as the side of the triangle
formed with sides u and v (as shown in Fig. 7-1), then ½N3  states that the length of one side of a triangle
cannot be greater than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.

Figure 7-1

Angle Between Vectors
For any nonzero vectors u and v in an inner product space V, the angle between u and v is deﬁned to be
the angle y such that 0  y  p and
cos y ¼

hu; vi
kukkvk

By the Cauchy–Schwartz inequality, 1  cos y  1, and so the angle exists and is unique.
EXAMPLE 7.5
(a) Consider vectors u ¼ ð2; 3; 5Þ and v ¼ ð1; 4; 3Þ in R3 . Then

hu; vi ¼ 2  12 þ 15 ¼ 5;

kvk ¼

Then the angle y between u and v is given by

cos y ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃpﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

Note that y is an acute angle, because cos y is positive.

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

7.5

Orthogonality

Let V be an inner product space. The vectors u; v 2 V are said to be orthogonal and u is said to be
orthogonal to v if
hu; vi ¼ 0
The relation is clearly symmetric—if u is orthogonal to v, then hv; ui ¼ 0, and so v is orthogonal to u. We
note that 0 2 V is orthogonal to every v 2 V, because
h0; vi ¼ h0v; vi ¼ 0hv; vi ¼ 0
Conversely, if u is orthogonal to every v 2 V, then hu; ui ¼ 0 and hence u ¼ 0 by ½I3 : Observe that u and
v are orthogonal if and only if cos y ¼ 0, where y is the angle between u and v. Also, this is true if and
only if u and v are ‘‘perpendicular’’—that is, y ¼ p=2 (or y ¼ 90 ).
EXAMPLE 7.6
(a) Consider the vectors u ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ, v ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, w ¼ ð1; 4; 3Þ in R3 . Then

hu; vi ¼ 1 þ 2  3 ¼ 0;

hu; wi ¼ 1  4 þ 3 ¼ 0;

hv; wi ¼ 1  8  9 ¼ 16

Thus, u is orthogonal to v and w, but v and w are not orthogonal.
(b) Consider the functions sin t and cos t in the vector space C½p; p of continuous functions on the closed interval
½p; p. Then

ðp
hsin t; cos ti ¼

p

sin t cos t dt ¼ 12 sin2 tjpp ¼ 0  0 ¼ 0

Thus, sin t and cos t are orthogonal functions in the vector space C½p; p.

Remark: A vector w ¼ ðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ is orthogonal to u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ in Rn if
hu; wi ¼ a1 x1 þ a2 x2 þ    þ an xn ¼ 0
That is, w is orthogonal to u if w satisﬁes a homogeneous equation whose coefﬁcients are the elements
of u.
EXAMPLE 7.7 Find a nonzero vector w that is orthogonal to u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 1Þ and u2 ¼ ð2; 5; 4Þ in R3 .
Let w ¼ ðx; y; zÞ. Then we want hu1 ; wi ¼ 0 and hu2 ; wi ¼ 0. This yields the homogeneous system

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 0
2x þ 5y þ 4z ¼ 0

or

x þ 2y þ z ¼ 0
y þ 2z ¼ 0

Here z is the only free variable in the echelon system. Set z ¼ 1 to obtain y ¼ 2 and x ¼ 3. Thus, w ¼ ð3; 2; 1Þ is
a desired nonzero vector orthogonal to u1 and u2 .
Any multiple of w will also be orthogonal to u1 and u2 . Normalizing w, we obtain the following unit vector
orthogonal to u1 and u2 :

Orthogonal Complements
Let S be a subset of an inner product space V. The orthogonal complement of S, denoted by S ? (read ‘‘S
perp’’) consists of those vectors in V that are orthogonal to every vector u 2 S; that is,
S ? ¼ fv 2 V : hv; ui ¼ 0 for every u 2 Sg

232

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

In particular, for a given vector u in V, we have
u? ¼ fv 2 V : hv; ui ¼ 0g
that is, u? consists of all vectors in V that are orthogonal to the given vector u.
We show that S ? is a subspace of V. Clearly 0 2 S ? , because 0 is orthogonal to every vector in V. Now
suppose v, w 2 S ? . Then, for any scalars a and b and any vector u 2 S, we have
hav þ bw; ui ¼ ahv; ui þ bhw; ui ¼ a  0 þ b  0 ¼ 0
Thus, av þ bw 2 S ? , and therefore S ? is a subspace of V.
We state this result formally.
PROPOSITION 7.3:

Let S be a subset of a vector space V. Then S ? is a subspace of V.

Remark 1: Suppose u is a nonzero vector in R3 . Then there is a geometrical description of u? .
Speciﬁcally, u? is the plane in R3 through the origin O and perpendicular to the vector u. This is shown
in Fig. 7-2.

Figure 7-2

Remark 2: Let W be the solution space of an m n homogeneous system AX ¼ 0, where A ¼ ½aij 
and X ¼ ½xi . Recall that W may be viewed as the kernel of the linear mapping A: Rn ! Rm . Now we can
give another interpretation of W using the notion of orthogonality. Speciﬁcally, each solution vector
w ¼ ðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ is orthogonal to each row of A; hence, W is the orthogonal complement of the row
space of A.
EXAMPLE 7.8 Find a basis for the subspace u? of R3 , where u ¼ ð1; 3; 4Þ.
Note that u? consists of all vectors w ¼ ðx; y; zÞ such that hu; wi ¼ 0, or x þ 3y  4z ¼ 0. The free variables
are y and z.
(1) Set y ¼ 1, z ¼ 0 to obtain the solution w1 ¼ ð3; 1; 0Þ.
(2) Set y ¼ 0, z ¼ 1 to obtain the solution w1 ¼ ð4; 0; 1Þ.
The vectors w1 and w2 form a basis for the solution space of the equation, and hence a basis for u? .

Suppose W is a subspace of V. Then both W and W ? are subspaces of V. The next theorem, whose
proof (Problem 7.28) requires results of later sections, is a basic result in linear algebra.

THEOREM 7.4:

Let W be a subspace of V. Then V is the direct sum of W and W ? ; that is,
V ¼ W W ?.

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

Orthogonal Sets and Bases

Consider a set S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur g of nonzero vectors in an inner product space V. S is called orthogonal
if each pair of vectors in S are orthogonal, and S is called orthonormal if S is orthogonal and each vector
in S has unit length. That is,
(i) Orthogonal: hui ; uj i ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j
0 for i 6¼ j
(ii) Orthonormal: hui ; uj i ¼
1 for i ¼ j
Normalizing an orthogonal set S refers to the process of multiplying each vector in S by the reciprocal of
its length in order to transform S into an orthonormal set of vectors.
The following theorems apply.
THEOREM 7.5:

Suppose S is an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors. Then S is linearly independent.

THEOREM 7.6:

(Pythagoras) Suppose fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur g is an orthogonal set of vectors. Then
ku1 þ u2 þ    þ ur k2 ¼ ku1 k2 þ ku2 k2 þ    þ kur k2

These theorems are proved in Problems 7.15 and 7.16, respectively. Here we prove the Pythagorean
theorem in the special and familiar case for two vectors. Speciﬁcally, suppose hu; vi ¼ 0. Then
ku þ vk2 ¼ hu þ v; u þ vi ¼ hu; ui þ 2hu; vi þ hv; vi ¼ hu; ui þ hv; vi ¼ kuk2 þ kvk2
which gives our result.
EXAMPLE 7.9
(a) Let E ¼ fe1 ; e2 ; e3 g ¼ fð1; 0; 0Þ; ð0; 1; 0Þ; ð0; 0; 1Þg be the usual basis of Euclidean space R3 . It is clear that

he1 ; e2 i ¼ he1 ; e3 i ¼ he2 ; e3 i ¼ 0

he1 ; e1 i ¼ he2 ; e2 i ¼ he3 ; e3 i ¼ 1

and

Namely, E is an orthonormal basis of R3 . More generally, the usual basis of Rn is orthonormal for every n.
(b) Let V ¼ C½p; p beÐ the vector space of continuous functions on the interval p  t  p with inner product
p
deﬁned by h f ; gi ¼ p f ðtÞgðtÞ dt. Then the following is a classical example of an orthogonal set in V :

f1; cos t; cos 2t; cos 3t; . . . ; sin t; sin 2t; sin 3t; . . .g
This orthogonal set plays a fundamental role in the theory of Fourier series.

Orthogonal Basis and Linear Combinations, Fourier Coefﬁcients
Let S consist of the following three vectors in R3 :
u1 ¼ ð1; 2; 1Þ;

u2 ¼ ð2; 1; 4Þ;

u3 ¼ ð3; 2; 1Þ

The reader can verify that the vectors are orthogonal; hence, they are linearly independent. Thus, S is an
orthogonal basis of R3 .
Suppose we want to write v ¼ ð7; 1; 9Þ as a linear combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 . First we set v as a linear
combination of u1 ; u2 ; u3 using unknowns x1 ; x2 ; x3 as follows:
v ¼ x1 u1 þ x2 u2 þ x3 u3

or

ð7; 1; 9Þ ¼ x1 ð1; 2; 1Þ þ x2 ð2; 1; 4Þ þ x3 ð3; 2; 1Þ

ð*Þ

We can proceed in two ways.
METHOD 1:

Expand ð*Þ (as in Chapter 3) to obtain the system
x1 þ 2x2 þ 3x3 ¼ 7;

2x1 þ x2  2x3 ¼ 1;

x1  4x2 þ x3 ¼ 7

Solve the system by Gaussian elimination to obtain x1 ¼ 3, x2 ¼ 1, x3 ¼ 2. Thus,
v ¼ 3u1  u2 þ 2u3 .

234
METHOD 2:

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality
(This method uses the fact that the basis vectors are orthogonal, and the arithmetic is
much simpler.) If we take the inner product of each side of ð*Þ with respect to ui , we get
hv; ui i ¼ hx1 u2 þ x2 u2 þ x3 u3 ; ui i

or

hv; ui i ¼ xi hui ; ui i

or

xi ¼

hv; ui i
hui ; ui i

Here two terms drop out, because u1 ; u2 ; u3 are orthogonal. Accordingly,
x1 ¼

hv; u1 i

x3 ¼

Thus, again, we get v ¼ 3u1  u2 þ 2u3 .
The procedure in Method 2 is true in general. Namely, we have the following theorem (proved in
Problem 7.17).
THEOREM 7.7:

Let fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g be an orthogonal basis of V. Then, for any v 2 V,

hv; ui i
is called the Fourier coefﬁcient of v with respect to ui , because it
hui ; ui i
is analogous to a coefﬁcient in the Fourier series of a function. This scalar also has a geometric
interpretation, which is discussed below.
Remark: The scalar ki 

Projections
Let V be an inner product space. Suppose w is a given nonzero vector in V, and suppose v is another
vector. We seek the ‘‘projection of v along w,’’ which, as indicated in Fig. 7-3(a), will be the multiple cw
of w such that v 0 ¼ v  cw is orthogonal to w. This means
hv; wi
hv  cw; wi ¼ 0
or
hv; wi  chw; wi ¼ 0
or
c¼
hw; wi

Figure 7-3

Accordingly, the projection of v along w is denoted and deﬁned by
projðv; wÞ ¼ cw ¼

hv; wi
w
hw; wi

Such a scalar c is unique, and it is called the Fourier coefﬁcient of v with respect to w or the component of
v along w.
The above notion is generalized as follows (see Problem 7.25).

Suppose w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wr form an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in V. Let v be any

Then v 0 is orthogonal to w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wr .
Note that each ci in the above theorem is the component (Fourier coefﬁcient) of v along the given wi .
Remark: The notion of the projection of a vector v 2 V along a subspace W of V is deﬁned as
follows. By Theorem 7.4, V ¼ W W ? . Hence, v may be expressed uniquely in the form
v ¼ w þ w0 ;

where

w2W

and w0 2 W ?

We deﬁne w to be the projection of v along W, and denote it by projðv; W Þ, as pictured in Fig. 7-2(b). In
particular, if W ¼ spanðw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wr Þ, where the wi form an orthogonal set, then
projðv; W Þ ¼ c1 w1 þ c2 w2 þ    þ cr wr
Here ci is the component of v along wi , as above.

Gram–Schmidt Orthogonalization Process

Suppose fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g is a basis of an inner product space V. One can use this basis to construct an
orthogonal basis fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn g of V as follows. Set
w1 ¼ v 1

In other words, for k ¼ 2; 3; . . . ; n, we deﬁne
wk ¼ v k  ck1 w1  ck2 w2      ck;k1 wk1
where cki ¼ hv k ; wi i=hwi ; wi i is the component of v k along wi . By Theorem 7.8, each wk is orthogonal to
the preceeding w’s. Thus, w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn form an orthogonal basis for V as claimed. Normalizing each wi
will then yield an orthonormal basis for V.
The above construction is known as the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process. The following
remarks are in order.
Remark 1: Each vector wk is a linear combination of v k and the preceding w’s. Hence, one can
easily show, by induction, that each wk is a linear combination of v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n .
Remark 2: Because taking multiples of vectors does not affect orthogonality, it may be simpler in
hand calculations to clear fractions in any new wk , by multiplying wk by an appropriate scalar, before
obtaining the next wkþ1 .

236

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

Remark 3: Suppose u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; ur are linearly independent, and so they form a basis for
U ¼ spanðui Þ. Applying the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process to the u’s yields an orthogonal
basis for U .
The following theorems (proved in Problems 7.26 and 7.27) use the above algorithm and remarks.
Let fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g be any basis of an inner product space V. Then there exists an
orthonormal basis fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of V such that the change-of-basis matrix from
fv i g to fui g is triangular; that is, for k ¼ 1; . . . ; n,

Orthogonal and Positive Deﬁnite Matrices

This section discusses two types of matrices that are closely related to real inner product spaces V. Here
vectors in Rn will be represented by column vectors. Thus, hu; vi ¼ uT v denotes the inner product in
Euclidean space Rn .

Orthogonal Matrices
A real matrix P is orthogonal if P is nonsingular and P1 ¼ PT , or, in other words, if PPT ¼ PT P ¼ I.
First we recall (Theorem 2.6) an important characterization of such matrices.
Let P be a real matrix. Then the following are equivalent: (a) P is orthogonal; (b)
the rows of P form an orthonormal set; (c) the columns of P form an orthonormal
set.
(This theorem is true only using the usual inner product on Rn . It is not true if Rn is given any other
inner product.)

Suppose E ¼ fei g and E0 ¼ fe0i g are orthonormal bases of V. Let P be the changeof-basis matrix from the basis E to the basis E0 . Then P is orthogonal.

Positive Deﬁnite Matrices
Let A be a real symmetric matrix; that is, AT ¼ A. Then A is said to be positive deﬁnite if, for every
nonzero vector u in Rn ,
hu; Aui ¼ uT Au > 0
Algorithms to decide whether or not a matrix A is positive deﬁnite will be given in Chapter 12. However,

A is not positive deﬁnite, because jAj ¼ 4  9 ¼ 5 is negative. B is not positive deﬁnite, because the diagonal
entry 3 is negative. However, C is positive deﬁnite, because the diagonal entries 1 and 5 are positive, and the
determinant jCj ¼ 5  4 ¼ 1 is also positive.

The following theorem (proved in Problem 7.44) holds.
THEOREM 7.15:

Let A be a real positive deﬁnite matrix. Then the function hu; vi ¼ uT Av is an inner
product on Rn .

Matrix Representation of an Inner Product (Optional)
Theorem 7.15 says that every positive deﬁnite matrix A determines an inner product on Rn . This
subsection may be viewed as giving the converse of this result.
Let V be a real inner product space with basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g. The matrix
A ¼ ½aij ;

where

aij ¼ hui ; uj i

is called the matrix representation of the inner product on V relative to the basis S.
Observe that A is symmetric, because the inner product is symmetric; that is, hui ; uj i ¼ huj ; ui i. Also, A
depends on both the inner product on V and the basis S for V. Moreover, if S is an orthogonal basis, then
A is diagonal, and if S is an orthonormal basis, then A is the identity matrix.
EXAMPLE 7.14 The vectors u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ, u2 ¼ ð1; 2; 3Þ, u3 ¼ ð1; 3; 5Þ form a basis S for Euclidean
space R3 . Find the matrix A that represents the inner product in R3 relative to this basis S.
First compute each hui ; uj i to obtain

Then, for any vectors u; v 2 V, we have
hu; vi ¼ ½uT A½v
where ½u and ½v denote the (column) coordinate vectors relative to the basis S.

Let A be the matrix representation of any inner product on V. Then A is a positive
deﬁnite matrix.

Complex Inner Product Spaces

This section considers vector spaces over the complex ﬁeld C. First we recall some properties of the
complex numbers (Section 1.7), especially the relations between a complex number z ¼ a þ bi; where
a; b 2 R; and its complex conjugate z ¼ a  bi:
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
z ¼ z
z
z ¼ a2 þ b2 ;
jzj ¼ a2 þ b2 ;
z1 þ z2 ¼ z1 þ z2
z1 z2 ¼ z1 z2 ;
Also, z is real if and only if z ¼ z.
The following deﬁnition applies.
DEFINITION:

Let V be a vector space over C. Suppose to each pair of vectors, u; v 2 V there is
assigned a complex number, denoted by hu; vi. This function is called a (complex) inner
product on V if it satisﬁes the following axioms:
½I1* (Linear Property) hau1 þ bu2 ; vi ¼ ahu1 ; vi þ bhu2 ; vi
½I2* (Conjugate Symmetric Property) hu; vi ¼ hv; ui
½I3* (Positive Deﬁnite Property) hu; ui  0; and hu; ui ¼ 0 if and only if u ¼ 0.

The vector space V over C with an inner product is called a (complex) inner product space.
Observe that a complex inner product differs from the real case only in the second axiom ½I 2*:
Axiom ½I1* (Linear Property) is equivalent to the two conditions:
ðaÞ

hu1 þ u2 ; vi ¼ hu1 ; vi þ hu2 ; vi;

ðbÞ hku; vi ¼ khu; vi

On the other hand, applying ½I 1* and ½I 2*, we obtain
 ui ¼ khu;
 vi
hu; kvi ¼ hkv; ui ¼ khv; ui ¼ khv;
That is, we must take the conjugate of a complex number when it is taken out of the second position of a
complex inner product. In fact (Problem 7.47), the inner product is conjugate linear in the second
position; that is,
 v2i
hu; av 1 þ bv 2 i ¼ ahu; v 1 i þ bhu;
Combining linear in the ﬁrst position and conjugate linear in the second position, we obtain, by induction,
*
+
P

ai ui ;
bj v j ¼ ai bj hui ; v j i

i;j

The following remarks are in order.
Remark 1: Axiom ½I1* by itself implies that h0; 0i ¼ h0v; 0i ¼ 0hv; 0i ¼ 0. Accordingly, ½I1*, ½I2*,
and ½I3* are equivalent to ½I1*, ½I2*, and the following axiom:
½I 3*0  If u 6¼ 0; then hu; ui > 0:
That is, a function satisfying ½I1 , ½I2*, and ½I3*0  is a (complex) inner product on V.
Remark 2: By ½I2*; hu; ui ¼ hu; ui. Thus, hu; ui must be real. By ½I3*; hu; ui must be nonnegative,
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
and hence, its positive real square root exists. As with real inner product spaces, we deﬁne kuk ¼ hu; ui
to be the norm or length of u.
Remark 3: In addition to the norm, we deﬁne the notions of orthogonality, orthogonal complement, and orthogonal and orthonormal sets as before. In fact, the deﬁnitions of distance and Fourier
coefﬁcient and projections are the same as in the real case.

is an inner product on V, called the usual or standard inner product on Cn . V with this inner product is called
Complex Euclidean Space. We assume this inner product on Cn unless otherwise stated or implied. Assuming u and
v are column vectors, the above inner product may be deﬁned by

hu; vi ¼ uT v
where, as with matrices, v means the conjugate of each element of v. If u and v are real, we have wi ¼ wi . In this
case, the inner product reduced to the analogous one on Rn .

Normed Vector Spaces (Optional)

We begin with a deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

Let V be a real or complex vector space. Suppose to each v 2 V there is assigned a real
number, denoted by kvk. This function k  k is called a norm on V if it satisﬁes the
following axioms:
½N1  kvk  0; and kvk ¼ 0 if and only if v ¼ 0.
½N2  kkvk ¼ jkjkvk.
½N3  ku þ vk  kuk þ kvk.

A vector space V with a norm is called a normed vector space.
Suppose V is a normed vector space. The distance between two vectors u and v in V is denoted and
deﬁned by
dðu; vÞ ¼ ku  vk
The following theorem (proved in Problem 7.56) is the main reason why dðu; vÞ is called the distance
between u and v.
THEOREM 7.24:

Let V be a normed vector space. Then the function dðu; vÞ ¼ ku  vk satisﬁes the
following three axioms of a metric space:
½M1  dðu; vÞ  0; and dðu; vÞ ¼ 0 if and only if u ¼ v.
½M2  dðu; vÞ ¼ dðv; uÞ.
½M3  dðu; vÞ  dðu; wÞ þ dðw; vÞ.

Normed Vector Spaces and Inner Product Spaces
Suppose V is an inner product space. Recall that the norm of a vector v in V is deﬁned by
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kvk ¼ hv; vi
One can prove (Theorem 7.2) that this norm satisﬁes ½N1 , ½N2 , and ½N3 . Thus, every inner product space
V is a normed vector space. On the other hand, there may be norms on a vector space V that do not come
from an inner product on V, as shown below.

Norms on Rn and Cn
The following deﬁne three important norms on Rn and Cn :
kða1 ; . . . ; an Þk1 ¼ maxðjai jÞ
kða1 ; . . . ; an Þk1 ¼ ja
j þ ja2 j þ    þ jan j
q1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ﬃ
kða1 ; . . . ; an Þk2 ¼

ja1 j2 þ ja2 j2 þ    þ jan j2

(Note that subscripts are used to distinguish between the three norms.) The norms k  k1 , k  k1 , and k  k2
are called the inﬁnity-norm, one-norm, and two-norm, respectively. Observe that k  k2 is the norm on Rn
(respectively, Cn ) induced by the usual inner product on Rn (respectively, Cn ). We will let d1 , d1 , d2
denote the corresponding distance functions.
EXAMPLE 7.17

Consider vectors u ¼ ð1; 5; 3Þ and v ¼ ð4; 2; 3Þ in R3 .

(a) The inﬁnity norm chooses the maximum of the absolute values of the components. Hence,
kuk1 ¼ 5

and

kvk1 ¼ 4

242

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

(b) The one-norm adds the absolute values of the components. Thus,
kuk1 ¼ 1 þ 5 þ 3 ¼ 9

and

kvk1 ¼ 4 þ 2 þ 3 ¼ 9

(c) The two-norm is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the components (i.e., the norm induced by
the usual inner product on R3 ). Thus,

kuk2 ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1 þ 25 þ 9 ¼ 35

and

kvk2 ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
16 þ 4 þ 9 ¼ 29

(d) Because u  v ¼ ð1  4; 5  2; 3 þ 3Þ ¼ ð3; 7; 6Þ, we have
d1 ðu; vÞ ¼ 7;

d1 ðu; vÞ ¼ 3 þ 7 þ 6 ¼ 16;

d2 ðu; vÞ ¼

pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
9 þ 49 þ 36 ¼ 94

Consider the Cartesian plane R2 shown in Fig. 7-4.

EXAMPLE 7.18

(a) Let D1 be the set of points u ¼ ðx; yÞ in R2 such that kuk2 ¼ 1. Then D1 consists of the points ðx; yÞ such that
kuk22 ¼ x2 þ y2 ¼ 1. Thus, D1 is the unit circle, as shown in Fig. 7-4.

Figure 7-4

(b) Let D2 be the set of points u ¼ ðx; yÞ in R2 such that kuk1 ¼ 1. Then D1 consists of the points ðx; yÞ such that
kuk1 ¼ jxj þ jyj ¼ 1. Thus, D2 is the diamond inside the unit circle, as shown in Fig. 7-4.
(c) Let D3 be the set of points u ¼ ðx; yÞ in R2 such that kuk1 ¼ 1. Then D3 consists of the points ðx; yÞ such that
kuk1 ¼ maxðjxj, jyjÞ ¼ 1. Thus, D3 is the square circumscribing the unit circle, as shown in Fig. 7-4.

Norms on C½a; b
Consider the vector space V ¼ C½a; b of real continuous functions on the interval a  t  b. Recall that
the following deﬁnes an inner product on V :
ðb
h f ; gi ¼

f ðtÞgðtÞ dt
a

Accordingly, the above inner product deﬁnes the following norm on V ¼ C½a; b (which is analogous to
the k  k2 norm on Rn ):
sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ðb
k f k2 ¼
½ f ðtÞ2 dt
a

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

243

The following deﬁne the other norms on V ¼ C½a; b:
ðb
and
k f k1 ¼ maxðj f ðtÞjÞ
k f k1 ¼ j f ðtÞj dt
a

There are geometrical descriptions of these two norms and their corresponding distance functions, which
are described below.
The ﬁrst norm is pictured in Fig. 7-5. Here
k f k1 ¼ area between the function j f j and the t-axis
d1 ð f ; gÞ ¼ area between the functions f and g

Figure 7-5

This norm is analogous to the norm k  k1 on Rn .
The second norm is pictured in Fig. 7-6. Here
k f k1 ¼ maximum distance between f and the t-axis
d1 ð f ; gÞ ¼ maximum distance between f and g
This norm is analogous to the norms k  k1 on Rn .

u  w; (c)

v  w, (d)

ðu þ vÞ  w, (e)

kuk, (f ) kvk.

(a) Multiply corresponding components and add to get u  v ¼ 2  6 þ 20 ¼ 16:
(b) u  w ¼ 4 þ 4  12 ¼ 4.
(c) v  w ¼ 8  6  15 ¼ 13.
(d) First ﬁnd u þ v ¼ ð3; 1; 9Þ. Then ðu þ vÞ  w ¼ 12  2  27 ¼ 17. Alternatively, using ½I1 ,
ðu þ vÞ  w ¼ u  w þ v  w ¼ 4  13 ¼ 17.
(e) First ﬁnd kuk2 by squaring the components of u and adding:
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kuk2 ¼ 12 þ 22 þ 42 ¼ 1 þ 4 þ 16 ¼ 21;
and so
kuk ¼ 21
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
(f ) kvk2 ¼ 4 þ 9 þ 25 ¼ 38, and so kvk ¼ 38.

7.3.

Verify that the following deﬁnes an inner product in R2 :
hu; vi ¼ x1 y1  x1 y2  x2 y1 þ 3x2 y2 ;
where
u ¼ ðx1 ; x2 Þ; v ¼ ðy1 ; y2 Þ
We argue via matrices. We can write hu; vi in matrix notation as follows:

 
1 1 y1
hu; vi ¼ uT Av ¼ ½x1 ; x2 
1
3 y2
Because A is real and symmetric, we need only show that A is positive deﬁnite. The diagonal elements 1 and
3 are positive, and the determinant kAk ¼ 3  1 ¼ 2 is positive. Thus, by Theorem 7.14, A is positive
deﬁnite. Accordingly, by Theorem 7.15, hu; vi is an inner product.

7.4.

Consider the vectors u ¼ ð1; 5Þ and v ¼ ð3; 4Þ in R2 . Find
(a) hu; vi with respect to the usual inner product in R2 .
(b) hu; vi with respect to the inner product in R2 in Problem 7.3.
(c) kvk using the usual inner product in R2 .
(d) kvk using the inner product in R2 in Problem 7.3.
(a) hu; vi ¼ 3 þ 20 ¼ 23.
(b) hu; vi ¼ 1  3  1  4  5  3 þ 3  5  4 ¼ 3  4  15 þ 60 ¼ 44.
(c) kvk2 ¼ hv; vi ¼ hð3; 4Þ; ð3; 4Þi ¼ 9 þ 16 ¼ 25; hence, jvk ¼ 5.
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
(d) kvk2 ¼ hv; vi ¼ hð3; 4Þ; ð3; 4Þi ¼ 9  12  12 þ 48 ¼ 33; hence, kvk ¼ 33.

Prove Theorem 7.1 (Cauchy–Schwarz): For u and v in a real inner product space V ;
hu; ui2  hu; uihv; vi or jhu; vij  kukkvk:
For any real number t,
htu þ v; tu þ vi ¼ t2 hu; ui þ 2thu; vi þ hv; vi ¼ t2 kuk2 þ 2thu; vi þ kvk2
Let a ¼ kuk2 , b ¼ 2hu; vÞ, c ¼ kvk2 . Because ktu þ vk2  0, we have
at2 þ bt þ c  0
for every value of t. This means that the quadratic polynomial cannot have two real roots, which implies that
b2  4ac  0 or b2  4ac. Thus,
4hu; vi2  4kuk2 kvk2
Dividing by 4 gives our result.

7.9.

Prove Theorem 7.2: The norm in an inner product space V satisﬁes
(a) ½N1  kvk  0; and kvk ¼ 0 if and only if v ¼ 0.
(b) ½N2  kkvk ¼ jkjkvk.
(c) ½N3  ku þ vk  kuk þ kvk.
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
(a) If v 6¼ p
0,ﬃﬃﬃ then hv; vi > 0, and hence, kvk ¼ hv; vi > 0. If v ¼ 0, then h0; 0i ¼ 0. Consequently,
k0k ¼ 0 ¼ 0. Thus, ½N1  is true.
(b) We have kkvk2 ¼ hkv; kvi ¼ k 2 hv; vi ¼ k 2 kvk2 . Taking the square root of both sides gives ½N2 .
(c) Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we obtain
ku þ vk2 ¼ hu þ v; u þ vi ¼ hu; ui þ hu; vi þ hu; vi þ hv; vi

Taking the square root of both sides yields ½N3 .

First ﬁnd

Then set hu; vi ¼ 9k  12 ¼ 0 to obtain k ¼ 43.

7.11. Let W be the subspace of R5 spanned by u ¼ ð1; 2; 3; 1; 2Þ and v ¼ ð2; 4; 7; 2; 1Þ. Find a

We seek all vectors w ¼ ðx; y; z; s; tÞ such that

hw; ui ¼ x þ 2y þ 3z  s þ 2t ¼ 0
hw; vi ¼ 2x þ 4y þ 7z þ 2s  t ¼ 0
Eliminating x from the second equation, we ﬁnd the equivalent system
x þ 2y þ 3z  s þ 2t ¼ 0
z þ 4s  5t ¼ 0

247

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality
The free variables are y; s, and t. Therefore,
(1) Set y ¼ 1, s ¼ 0, t ¼ 0 to obtain the solution w1 ¼ ð2; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ.
(2) Set y ¼ 0, s ¼ 1, t ¼ 0 to ﬁnd the solution w2 ¼ ð13; 0; 4; 1; 0Þ.
(3) Set y ¼ 0, s ¼ 0, t ¼ 1 to obtain the solution w3 ¼ ð17; 0; 5; 0; 1Þ.
The set fw1 ; w2 ; w3 g is a basis of W ? .

7.12. Let w ¼ ð1; 2; 3; 1Þ be a vector in R4 . Find an orthogonal basis for w? .

Find a nonzero solution of x þ 2y þ 3z þ t ¼ 0, say v 1 ¼ ð0; 0; 1; 3Þ. Now ﬁnd a nonzero solution of
the system
x þ 2y þ 3z þ t ¼ 0;
z  3t ¼ 0

say v 2 ¼ ð0; 5; 3; 1Þ. Last, ﬁnd a nonzero solution of the system
x þ 2y þ 3z þ t ¼ 0;

5y þ 3z þ t ¼ 0;

z  3t ¼ 0

say v 3 ¼ ð14; 2; 3; 1Þ. Thus, v 1 , v 2 , v 3 form an orthogonal basis for w? .

7.13. Let S consist of the following vectors in R4 :
u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 0; 1Þ; u2 ¼ ð1; 2; 1; 3Þ; u3 ¼ ð1; 1; 9; 2Þ; u4 ¼ ð16; 13; 1; 3Þ
(a) Show that S is orthogonal and a basis of R4 .
(b) Find the coordinates of an arbitrary vector v ¼ ða; b; c; dÞ in R4 relative to the basis S.
(a) Compute
u1  u2 ¼ 1 þ 2 þ 0  3 ¼ 0;
u2  u3 ¼ 1 þ 2  9 þ 6 ¼ 0;

u1  u3 ¼ 1 þ 1 þ 0  2 ¼ 0;
u2  u4 ¼ 16  26 þ 1 þ 9 ¼ 0;

u1  u4 ¼ 16  13 þ 0  3 ¼ 0
u3  u4 ¼ 16  13  9 þ 6 ¼ 0

Thus, S is orthogonal, and S is linearly independent. Accordingly, S is a basis for R4 because any four
linearly independent vectors form a basis of R4 .
(b) Because S is orthogonal, we need only ﬁnd the Fourier coefﬁcients of v with respect to the basis vectors,
as in Theorem 7.7. Thus,

(a) S  S ?? .
(b) If S1  S2 , then S2?  S1? .
(c) S ? ¼ span ðSÞ? .
(a) Let w 2 S. Then hw; vi ¼ 0 for every v 2 S ? ; hence, w 2 S ?? . Accordingly, S  S ?? .
(b) Let w 2 S2? . Then hw; vi ¼ 0 for every v 2 S2 . Because S1  S2 , hw; vi ¼ 0 for every v ¼ S1 . Thus,
w 2 S1? , and hence, S2?  S1? .
(c) Because S  spanðSÞ, part (b) gives us spanðSÞ?  S ? . Suppose u 2 S ? and v 2 spanðSÞ. Then there
exist w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wk in S such that v ¼ a1 w1 þ a2 w2 þ    þ ak wk . Then, using u 2 S ? , we have

Thus, u 2 spanðSÞ? . Accordingly, S ?  spanðSÞ? . Both inclusions give S ? ¼ spanðSÞ? .

But hui ; ui i 6¼ 0, and hence, every ai ¼ 0. Thus, S is linearly independent.

If v 0 is orthogonal to w1 , then

Thus, c1 ¼ hv; w1 i=hw1 ; w1 i. (That is, c1 is the component of v along w1 .) Similarly, if v 0 is orthogonal to w2 ,
then
0 ¼ hv  c1 w1  c2 w2 ; w2 i ¼ hv; w2 i  c2 hw2 ; w2 i
Thus, c2 ¼ hv; w2 i=hw2 ; w2 i. (That is, c2 is the component of v along w2 .)

7.26. Prove Theorem 7.9: Let fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g be any basis of an inner product space V. Then there
exists an orthonormal basis fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of V such that the change-of-basis matrix from fv i g to
fui g is triangular; that is, for k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n,
uk ¼ ak1 v 1 þ ak2 v 2 þ    þ akk v k
The proof uses the Gram–Schmidt algorithm and Remarks 1 and 3 of Section 7.7. That is, apply the
algorithm to fv i g to obtain an orthogonal basis fwi ; . . . ; wn g, and then normalize fwi g to obtain an
orthonormal basis fui g of V. The speciﬁc algorithm guarantees that each wk is a linear combination of
v 1 ; . . . ; v k , and hence, each uk is a linear combination of v 1 ; . . . ; v k .

7.27. Prove Theorem 7.10: Suppose S ¼ fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wr g, is an orthogonal basis for a subspace W of V.
Then one may extend S to an orthogonal basis for V; that is, one may ﬁnd vectors wrþ1 ; . . . ; wr
such that fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn g is an orthogonal basis for V.
Extend S to a basis S 0 ¼ fw1 ; . . . ; wr ; v rþ1 ; . . . ; v n g for V. Applying the Gram–Schmidt algorithm to S 0 ,
we ﬁrst obtain w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wr because S is orthogonal, and then we obtain vectors wrþ1 ; . . . ; wn , where
fw1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wn g is an orthogonal basis for V. Thus, the theorem is proved.

7.28. Prove Theorem 7.4: Let W be a subspace of V. Then V ¼ W

W ?.

By Theorem 7.9, there exists an orthogonal basis fu1 ; . . . ; ur g of W , and by Theorem 7.10 we can
extend it to an orthogonal basis fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of V. Hence, urþ1 ; . . . ; un 2 W ? . If v 2 V, then
v ¼ a1 u1 þ    þ an un ; where a1 u1 þ    þ ar ur 2 W and arþ1 urþ1 þ    þ an un 2 W ?
Accordingly, V ¼ W þ W ? .
On the other hand, if w 2 W \ W ? , then hw; wi ¼ 0. This yields w ¼ 0. Hence, W \ W ? ¼ f0g.
The two conditions V ¼ W þ W ? and W \ W ? ¼ f0g give the desired result V ¼ W W ? .

Remark: Note that we have proved the theorem for the case that V has ﬁnite dimension. We
remark that the theorem also holds for spaces of arbitrary dimension.
7.29. Suppose W is a subspace of a ﬁnite-dimensional space V. Prove that W ¼ W ?? .
By Theorem 7.4, V ¼ W

W ? , and also V ¼ W ?

dim W ¼ dim V  dim W ?

and

W ?? . Hence,
dim W ?? ¼ dim V  dim W ?

This yields dim W ¼ dim W ?? . But W  W ?? (see Problem 7.14). Hence, W ¼ W ?? , as required.

7.30. Prove the following: Suppose w1 ; w2 ; . . . ; wr form an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in V. Let v be

7.32. Find an orthogonal matrix P whose ﬁrst row is u1 ¼ ð13 ; 23 ; 23Þ.

First ﬁnd a nonzero vector w2 ¼ ðx; y; zÞ that is orthogonal to u1 —that is, for which

u2 ¼ ð0; 1= 2; 1= 2Þ
Next ﬁnd a nonzero vector w3 ¼ ðx; y; zÞ that is orthogonal to both u1 and u2 —that is, for which

(b) Yes, because the rows of B are still orthogonal and are now unit vectors.
(c) Yes, because the rows of B form an orthonormal set of vectors. Then, by Theorem 7.11, the columns of
B must automatically form an orthonormal set.

7.35. Prove each of the following:
(a) P is orthogonal if and only if PT is orthogonal.
(b) If P is orthogonal, then P1 is orthogonal.
(c) If P and Q are orthogonal, then PQ is orthogonal.
(a) We have ðPT ÞT ¼ P. Thus, P is orthogonal if and only if PPT ¼ I if and only if PTT PT ¼ I if and only if
PT is orthogonal.
(b) We have PT ¼ P1 , because P is orthogonal. Thus, by part (a), P1 is orthogonal.
(c) We have PT ¼ P1 and QT ¼ Q1 . Thus, ðPQÞðPQÞT ¼ PQQT PT ¼ PQQ1 P1 ¼ I. Therefore,
ðPQÞT ¼ ðPQÞ1 , and so PQ is orthogonal.

(a) hPu; Pvi ¼ hu; vi for any u; v 2 V ;

Use PT P ¼ I and hu; vi ¼ uT v.
(a) hPu; Pvi ¼ ðPuÞT ðPvÞ ¼ uT PT Pv ¼ uT v ¼ hu; vi.
(b) We have
kPuk2 ¼ hPu; Pui ¼ uT PT Pu ¼ uT u ¼ hu; ui ¼ kuk2
Taking the square root of both sides gives our result.

7.37. Prove Theorem 7.12: Suppose E ¼ fei g and E0 ¼ fe0i g are orthonormal bases of V. Let P be the
change-of-basis matrix from E to E0 . Then P is orthogonal.
Suppose
e0i ¼ bi1 e1 þ bi2 e2 þ    þ bin en ;

i ¼ 1; . . . ; n

Let B ¼ ½bij  be the matrix of the coefﬁcients in (1). (Then P ¼ B .) Suppose BB ¼ ½cij . Then

By (2) and (3), we have cij ¼ dij . Thus, BBT ¼ I. Accordingly, B is orthogonal, and hence, P ¼ BT is

P ¼ ½aij  be an orthogonal matrix. Then the following n vectors form an orthonormal basis for V :
e0i ¼ a1i e1 þ a2i e2 þ    þ ani en ;

Because fei g is orthonormal, we get, by Problem 7.18(b),
he0i ; e0j i ¼ a1i a1j þ a2i a2j þ    þ ani anj ¼ hCi ; Cj i

where Ci denotes the ith column of the orthogonal matrix P ¼ ½aij : Because P is orthogonal, its columns
form an orthonormal set. This implies he0i ; e0j i ¼ hCi ; Cj i ¼ dij : Thus, fe0i g is an orthonormal basis.

7.44. Prove Theorem 7.15: Let A be a real positive deﬁnite matrix. Then the function hu; vi ¼ uT Av is
an inner product on Rn .
For any vectors u1 ; u2 , and v,
hu1 þ u2 ; vi ¼ ðu1 þ u2 ÞT Av ¼ ðuT1 þ uT2 ÞAv ¼ uT1 Av þ uT2 Av ¼ hu1 ; vi þ hu2 ; vi
and, for any scalar k and vectors u; v,
hku; vi ¼ ðkuÞT Av ¼ kuT Av ¼ khu; vi
Thus ½I1  is satisﬁed.
Because uT Av is a scalar, ðuT AvÞT ¼ uT Av. Also, AT ¼ A because A is symmetric. Therefore,
hu; vi ¼ uT Av ¼ ðuT AvÞT ¼ v T AT uTT ¼ v T Au ¼ hv; ui
Thus, ½I2  is satisﬁed.
Last, because A is positive deﬁnite, X T AX > 0 for any nonzero X 2 Rn . Thus, for any nonzero vector
v; hv; vi ¼ v T Av > 0. Also, h0; 0i ¼ 0T A0 ¼ 0. Thus, ½I3  is satisﬁed. Accordingly, the function hu; vi ¼ Av

CHAPTER 7 Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonality

7.46. Prove Theorem 7.17: Let A be the matrix representation of any inner product on V. Then A is a
positive deﬁnite matrix.

Because hwi ; wj i ¼ hwj ; wi i for any basis vectors wi and wj , the matrix A is symmetric. Let X be any
nonzero vector in Rn . Then ½u ¼ X for some nonzero vector u 2 V. Theorem 7.16 tells us that
X T AX ¼ ½uT A½u ¼ hu; ui > 0. Thus, A is positive deﬁnite.

Complex Inner Product Spaces
7.47. Let V be a complex inner product space. Verify the relation
 v2i
hu; av 1 þ bv 2 i ¼ ahu; v 1 i þ bhu;
Using ½I*,

hu; av 1 þ bv 2 i ¼ hav 1 þ bv 2 ; ui ¼ ahv 1 ; ui þ bhv 2 ; ui ¼ ahv 1 ; ui þ bhv

7.48. Suppose hu; vi ¼ 3 þ 2i in a complex inner product space V. Find
(a) hð2  4iÞu; vi; (b) hu; ð4 þ 3iÞvi; (c) hð3  6iÞu; ð5  2iÞvi:
(a) hð2  4iÞu; vi ¼ ð2  4iÞhu; vi ¼ ð2  4iÞð3 þ 2iÞ ¼ 14  8i
(b) hu; ð4 þ 3iÞvi ¼ ð4 þ 3iÞhu; vi ¼ ð4  3iÞð3 þ 2iÞ ¼ 18  i

7.49. Find the Fourier coefﬁcient (component) c and the projection cw of v ¼ ð3 þ 4i; 2  3iÞ along

Recall that c ¼ hv; wi=hw; wi. Compute
hv; wi ¼ ð3 þ 4iÞð5 þ iÞ þ ð2  3iÞð2iÞ ¼ ð3 þ 4iÞð5  iÞ þ ð2  3iÞð2iÞ

Thus, c ¼ ð13 þ 13iÞ=30 ¼ 13

7.50. Prove Theorem 7.18 (Cauchy–Schwarz): Let V be a complex inner product space. Then
jhu; vij  kukkvk.
If v ¼ 0, the inequality reduces to 0  0 and hence is valid. Now suppose v 6¼ 0. Using z
z ¼ jzj2 (for

any complex number z) and hv; ui ¼ hu; vi, we expand ku  hu; vitvk  0, where t is any real value:

Here u? consists of all vectors s ¼ ðx; y; zÞ such that

Find one solution, say w1 ¼ ð0; 1  i; iÞ. Then ﬁnd a solution of the system
x  iy þ ð1  iÞz ¼ 0;

ð1 þ iÞy  iz ¼ 0

Here z is a free variable. Set z ¼ 1 to obtain y ¼ i=ð1 þ iÞ ¼ ð1 þ iÞ=2 and x ¼ ð3i  3Þ2. Multiplying by 2
yields the solution w2 ¼ ð3i  3, 1 þ i, 2). The vectors w1 and w2 form an orthogonal basis for u? .

(a) kuk1 and kvj1 , (b) kuk1 and kvk1 , (c)
(d) d1 ðu; vÞ; d1 ðu; vÞ, d2 ðu; vÞ.

kuk2 and kvk2 ,

(a) The inﬁnity norm chooses the maximum of the absolute values of the components. Hence,
kuk1 ¼ 6

and

kvk1 ¼ 5

(b) The one-norm adds the absolute values of the components. Thus,
kuk1 ¼ 1 þ 3 þ 6 þ 4 ¼ 14

and

kvk1 ¼ 3 þ 5 þ 1 þ 2 ¼ 11

(c) The two-norm is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the components (i.e., the norm
induced by the usual inner product on R3 ). Thus,

(a) We seek k f k1 ¼ maxðj f ðtÞjÞ. Because f ðtÞ is differentiable on ½0; 3, j f ðtÞj has a maximum at a
critical point of f ðtÞ (i.e., when the derivative f 0 ðtÞ ¼ 0), or at an endpoint of ½0; 3. Because
f 0 ðtÞ ¼ 2t  4, we set 2t  4 ¼ 0 and obtain t ¼ 2 as a critical point. Compute
f ð2Þ ¼ 4  8 ¼ 4;
Thus, k f k1 ¼ j f ð2Þj ¼ j  4j ¼ 4.

f ð0Þ ¼ 0  0 ¼ 0;

½M2  dðu; vÞ ¼ dðv; uÞ.
½M3  dðu; vÞ  dðu; wÞ þ dðw; vÞ.

If u 6¼ v, then u  v 6¼ 0, and hence, dðu; vÞ ¼ ku  vk > 0. Also, dðu; uÞ ¼ ku  uk ¼ k0k ¼ 0. Thus,
½M1  is satisﬁed. We also have

dðu; vÞ ¼ ku  vk ¼ k  1ðv  uÞk ¼ j  1jkv  uk ¼ kv  uk ¼ dðv; uÞ

Determinants

Introduction

Each n-square matrix A ¼ ½aij  is assigned a special scalar called the determinant of A, denoted by detðAÞ
or jAj or

We emphasize that an n n array of scalars enclosed by straight lines, called a determinant of order n, is
not a matrix but denotes the determinant of the enclosed array of scalars (i.e., the enclosed matrix).
The determinant function was ﬁrst discovered during the investigation of systems of linear equations.
We shall see that the determinant is an indispensable tool in investigating and obtaining properties of
square matrices.
The deﬁnition of the determinant and most of its properties also apply in the case where the entries of a
matrix come from a commutative ring.
We begin with a special case of determinants of orders 1, 2, and 3. Then we deﬁne a determinant of
arbitrary order. This general deﬁnition is preceded by a discussion of permutations, which is necessary for
our general deﬁnition of the determinant.

8.2

Determinants of Orders 1 and 2

Determinants of orders 1 and 2 are deﬁned as follows:


 a11 a12 


ja11 j ¼ a11
and
 a21 a22  ¼ a11 a22  a12 a21
Thus, the determinant of a 1 1 matrix A ¼ ½a11  is the scalar a11 ; that is, detðAÞ ¼ ja11 j ¼ a11 . The
determinant of order two may easily be remembered by using the following diagram:
 
þ 
 a12 
 a11
 a21 a22 
!
That, is, the determinant is equal to the product of the elements along the plus-labeled arrow minus the
product of the elements along the minus-labeled arrow. (There is an analogous diagram for determinants
of order 3, but not for higher-order determinants.)

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

Application to Linear Equations
Consider two linear equations in two unknowns, say
a1 z þ b1 y ¼ c1
a2 x þ b2 y ¼ c2
Let D ¼ a1 b2  a2 b1 , the determinant of the matrix of coefﬁcients. Then the system has a unique solution
if and only if D 6¼ 0. In such a case, the unique solution may be expressed completely in terms of
determinants as follows:




 c1 b1 
 a1 c1 




Ny a1 c2  a2 c1  a2 c2 
Nx b2 c1  b1 c2  c2 b2 
;

x¼
¼
¼
¼
¼
y¼
D a1 b2  a2 b1  a1 b1 
D a1 b2  a2 b1  a1 b1 
 a2 b2 
 a2 b2 
Here D appears in the denominator of both quotients. The numerators Nx and Ny of the quotients for x and
y, respectively, can be obtained by substituting the column of constant terms in place of the column of
coefﬁcients of the given unknown in the matrix of coefﬁcients. On the other hand, if D ¼ 0, then the
system may have no solution or more than one solution.

EXAMPLE 8.2

Solve by determinants the system

4x  3y ¼ 15
2x þ 5y ¼ 1

First ﬁnd the determinant D of the matrix of coefﬁcients:


4
D ¼ 
2


3 
¼ 4ð5Þ  ð3Þð2Þ ¼ 20 þ 6 ¼ 26
5

Because D 6¼ 0, the system has a unique solution. To obtain the numerators Nx and Ny , simply replace, in the matrix
of coefﬁcients, the coefﬁcients of x and y, respectively, by the constant terms, and then take their determinants:



 15 3 

 ¼ 75 þ 3 ¼ 78
Nx ¼ 
1
5



 4 15 

 ¼ 4  30 ¼ 26
Ny ¼ 

Then the unique solution of the system is

Determinants of Order 3

Consider an arbitrary 3 3 matrix A ¼ ½aij . The determinant of A is deﬁned as follows:


 a11 a12 a13 


detðAÞ ¼  a21 a22 a23  ¼ a11 a22 a33 þ a12 a23 a31 þ a13 a21 a32  a13 a22 a31  a12 a21 a33  a11 a23 a32
a
a32 a33 
31
Observe that there are six products, each product consisting of three elements of the original matrix.
Three of the products are plus-labeled (keep their sign) and three of the products are minus-labeled
(change their sign).
The diagrams in Fig. 8-1 may help us to remember the above six products in detðAÞ. That is, the
determinant is equal to the sum of the products of the elements along the three plus-labeled arrows in

266

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

Fig. 8-1 plus the sum of the negatives of the products of the elements along the three minus-labeled
arrows. We emphasize that there are no such diagrammatic devices with which to remember determinants
of higher order.

detðAÞ ¼ a11 ða22 a23  a23 a32 Þ  a12 ða21 a33  a23 a31 Þ þ a13 ða21 a32  a22 a31 Þ

Permutations

A permutation s of the set f1; 2; . . . ; ng is a one-to-one mapping of the set onto itself or, equivalently, a
rearrangement of the numbers 1; 2; . . . ; n. Such a permutation s is denoted by


1 2 ... n
s¼
where ji ¼ sðiÞ
or
s ¼ j1 j2    jn ;
j1 j2 . . . jn
The set of all such permutations is denoted by Sn , and the number of such permutations is n!. If s 2 Sn ;
then the inverse mapping s1 2 Sn ; and if s; t 2 Sn , then the composition mapping s  t 2 Sn . Also, the
identity mapping e ¼ s  s1 2 Sn . (In fact, e ¼ 123 . . . n.)
EXAMPLE 8.5

(a) There are 2! ¼ 2  1 ¼ 2 permutations in S2 ; they are 12 and 21.
(b) There are 3! ¼ 3  2  1 ¼ 6 permutations in S3 ; they are 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.

Sign (Parity) of a Permutation
Consider an arbitrary permutation s in Sn , say s ¼ j1 j2    jn : We say s is an even or odd permutation
according to whether there is an even or odd number of inversions in s. By an inversion in s we mean a
pair of integers ði; kÞ such that i > k, but i precedes k in s. We then deﬁne the sign or parity of s, written
sgn s, by
1 if s is even
sgn s ¼
1 if s is odd
EXAMPLE 8.6

(a) Find the sign of s ¼ 35142 in S5 .
For each element k, we count the number of elements i such that i > k and i precedes k in s. There are

2 numbers ð3 and 5Þ greater than and preceding 1;
3 numbers ð3; 5; and 4Þ greater than and preceding 2;
1 number ð5Þ greater than and preceding 4:
(There are no numbers greater than and preceding either 3 or 5.) Because there are, in all, six inversions, s is
even and sgn s ¼ 1.
(b) The identity permutation e ¼ 123 . . . n is even because there are no inversions in e.
(c) In S2 , the permutation 12 is even and 21 is odd. In S3 , the permutations 123, 231, 312 are even and the
permutations 132, 213, 321 are odd.
(d) Let t be the permutation that interchanges two numbers i and j and leaves the other numbers ﬁxed. That is,

tðiÞ ¼ j;

tðjÞ ¼ i;

tðkÞ ¼ k;

where

k 6¼ i; j

We call t a transposition. If i < j, then there are 2ð j  iÞ  1 inversions in t, and hence, the transposition t
is odd.

Remark: One can show that, for any n, half of the permutations in Sn are even and half of them are
odd. For example, 3 of the 6 permutations in S3 are even, and 3 are odd.

Determinants of Arbitrary Order

Let A ¼ ½aij  be a square matrix of order n over a ﬁeld K.
Consider a product of n elements of A such that one and only one element comes from each row and
one and only one element comes from each column. Such a product can be written in the form
a1j1 a2j2    anjn

268

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

that is, where the factors come from successive rows, and so the ﬁrst subscripts are in the natural order
1; 2; . . . ; n. Now because the factors come from different columns, the sequence of second subscripts
forms a permutation s ¼ j1 j2    jn in Sn . Conversely, each permutation in Sn determines a product of the
above form. Thus, the matrix A contains n! such products.
DEFINITION:

The determinant of A ¼ ½aij , denoted by detðAÞ or jAj, is the sum of all the above n!
products, where each such product is multiplied by sgn s. That is,
P
jAj ¼ ðsgn sÞa1j1 a2j2    anjn
Ps
or
jAj ¼
ðsgn sÞa1sð1Þ a2sð2Þ    ansðnÞ
s2Sn

The determinant of the n-square matrix A is said to be of order n.
The next example shows that the above deﬁnition agrees with the previous deﬁnition of determinants
of orders 1, 2, and 3.
EXAMPLE 8.7

(a) Let A ¼ ½a11  be a 1
itself.

1 matrix. Because S1 has only one permutation, which is even, detðAÞ ¼ a11 , the number

(b) Let A ¼ ½aij  be a 2



(c) Let A ¼ ½aij  be a 3 3 matrix. In S3 , the permutations 123, 231, 312 are even, and the permutations 321, 213,
132 are odd. Hence,


 a11 a12 a13 


detðAÞ ¼  a21 a22 a23  ¼ a11 a22 a33 þ a12 a23 a31 þ a13 a21 a32  a13 a22 a31  a12 a21 a33  a11 a23 a32

31 a32 a33

Remark: As n increases, the number of terms in the determinant becomes astronomical.
Accordingly, we use indirect methods to evaluate determinants rather than the deﬁnition of the
determinant. In fact, we prove a number of properties about determinants that will permit us to shorten
the computation considerably. In particular, we show that a determinant of order n is equal to a linear
combination of determinants of order n  1, as in the case n ¼ 3 above.

8.6

Properties of Determinants

We now list basic properties of the determinant.
THEOREM 8.1:

The determinant of a matrix A and its transpose AT are equal; that is, jAj ¼ jAT j.

By this theorem (proved in Problem 8.22), any theorem about the determinant of a matrix A that
concerns the rows of A will have an analogous theorem concerning the columns of A.
The next theorem (proved in Problem 8.24) gives certain cases for which the determinant can be
obtained immediately.
THEOREM 8.2:

Let A be a square matrix.
(i) If A has a row (column) of zeros, then jAj ¼ 0.
(ii) If A has two identical rows (columns), then jAj ¼ 0.

CHAPTER 8 Determinants
(iii)

269

If A is triangular (i.e., A has zeros above or below the diagonal), then
jAj ¼ product of diagonal elements. Thus, in particular, jIj ¼ 1, where I is the
identity matrix.

The next theorem (proved in Problems 8.23 and 8.25) shows how the determinant of a matrix is
affected by the elementary row and column operations.
THEOREM 8.3:

Suppose B is obtained from A by an elementary row (column) operation.
(i) If two rows (columns) of A were interchanged, then jBj ¼ jAj.
(ii) If a row (column) of A were multiplied by a scalar k, then jBj ¼ kjAj.
(iii) If a multiple of a row (column) of A were added to another row (column) of A,
then jBj ¼ jAj.

Major Properties of Determinants
We now state two of the most important and useful theorems on determinants.
THEOREM 8.4:

The determinant of a product of two matrices A and B is the product of their
determinants; that is,
detðABÞ ¼ detðAÞ detðBÞ

The above theorem says that the determinant is a multiplicative function.
THEOREM 8.5:

Let A be a square matrix. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) A is invertible; that is, A has an inverse A1 .
(ii) AX ¼ 0 has only the zero solution.
(iii) The determinant of A is not zero; that is, detðAÞ 6¼ 0.

Remark: Depending on the author and the text, a nonsingular matrix A is deﬁned to be an
invertible matrix A, or a matrix A for which jAj 6¼ 0, or a matrix A for which AX ¼ 0 has only the zero
solution. The above theorem shows that all such deﬁnitions are equivalent.
We will prove Theorems 8.4 and 8.5 (in Problems 8.29 and 8.28, respectively) using the theory of
elementary matrices and the following lemma (proved in Problem 8.26), which is a special case of
Theorem 8.4.
LEMMA 8.6:

Let E be an elementary matrix. Then, for any matrix A; jEAj ¼ jEjjAj.

Recall that matrices A and B are similar if there exists a nonsingular matrix P such that B ¼ P1 AP.
Using the multiplicative property of the determinant (Theorem 8.4), one can easily prove (Problem 8.31)
the following theorem.
THEOREM 8.7:

8.7

Suppose A and B are similar matrices. Then jAj ¼ jBj.

Minors and Cofactors

Consider an n-square matrix A ¼ ½aij . Let Mij denote the ðn  1Þ-square submatrix of A obtained by
deleting its ith row and jth column. The determinant jMij j is called the minor of the element aij of A, and
we deﬁne the cofactor of aij , denoted by Aij ; to be the ‘‘signed’’ minor:
Aij ¼ ð1Þiþj jMij j

270

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

Note that the ‘‘signs’’ ð1Þiþj accompanying the minors form a chessboard pattern with þ’s on the main
diagonal:

þ  þ  ...
6 þ  þ ... 7
6
7
4þ  þ  ... 5

We emphasize that Mij denotes a matrix, whereas Aij denotes a scalar.
Remark: The sign ð1Þiþj of the cofactor Aij is frequently obtained using the checkerboard pattern.
Speciﬁcally, beginning with þ and alternating signs:
þ; ; þ; ; . . . ;
count from the main diagonal to the appropriate square.

Laplace Expansion
The following theorem (proved in Problem 8.32) holds.
THEOREM 8.8:

(Laplace) The determinant of a square matrix A ¼ ½aij  is equal to the sum of the
products obtained by multiplying the elements of any row (column) by their
respective cofactors:
n
P
jAj ¼ ai1 Ai1 þ ai2 Ai2 þ    þ ain Ain ¼
aij Aij

jAj ¼ a1j A1j þ a2j A2j þ    þ anj Anj ¼

i¼1

The above formulas for jAj are called the Laplace expansions of the determinant of A by the ith row
and the jth column. Together with the elementary row (column) operations, they offer a method of
simplifying the computation of jAj, as described below.

8.8

Evaluation of Determinants

The following algorithm reduces the evaluation of a determinant of order n to the evaluation of a
determinant of order n  1.
ALGORITHM 8.1:

(Reduction of the order of a determinant) The input is a nonzero n-square matrix
A ¼ ½aij  with n > 1.

Step 1. Choose an element aij ¼ 1 or, if lacking, aij 6¼ 0.
Step 2. Using aij as a pivot, apply elementary row (column) operations to put 0’s in all the other
positions in the column (row) containing aij .
Step 3. Expand the determinant by the column (row) containing aij .

271

CHAPTER 8 Determinants
The following remarks are in order.

Remark 1: Algorithm 8.1 is usually used for determinants of order 4 or more. With determinants
of order less than 4, one uses the speciﬁc formulas for the determinant.
Remark 2: Gaussian elimination or, equivalently, repeated use of Algorithm 8.1 together with row
interchanges can be used to transform a matrix A into an upper triangular matrix whose determinant is the
product of its diagonal entries. However, one must keep track of the number of row interchanges, because
each row interchange changes the sign of the determinant.

value of the determinant does not change under these operations. Thus,

Classical Adjoint

Let A ¼ ½aij  be an n n matrix over a ﬁeld K and let Aij denote the cofactor of aij . The classical adjoint
of A, denoted by adj A, is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A. Namely,
adj A ¼ ½Aij T
We say ‘‘classical adjoint’’ instead of simply ‘‘adjoint’’ because the term ‘‘adjoint’’ is currently used for
an entirely different concept.

Applications to Linear Equations, Cramer’s Rule

Consider a system AX ¼ B of n linear equations in n unknowns. Here A ¼ ½aij  is the (square) matrix of
coefﬁcients and B ¼ ½bi  is the column vector of constants. Let Ai be the matrix obtained from A by
replacing the ith column of A by the column vector B. Furthermore, let
D ¼ detðAÞ;

N1 ¼ detðA1 Þ;

N2 ¼ detðA2 Þ;

...;

Nn ¼ detðAn Þ

The fundamental relationship between determinants and the solution of the system AX ¼ B follows.
THEOREM 8.10:

The (square) system AX ¼ B has a solution if and only if D 6¼ 0. In this case, the
unique solution is given by
x1 ¼

N1
;
D

x2 ¼

N2
;
D

...;

xn ¼

D

The above theorem (proved in Problem 8.10) is known as Cramer’s rule for solving systems of linear
equations. We emphasize that the theorem only refers to a system with the same number of equations as
unknowns, and that it only gives the solution when D 6¼ 0. In fact, if D ¼ 0, the theorem does not tell us
whether or not the system has a solution. However, in the case of a homogeneous system, we have the
following useful result (to be proved in Problem 8.54).
THEOREM 8.11:

A square homogeneous system AX ¼ 0 has a nonzero solution if and only if
D ¼ jAj ¼ 0.

Submatrices, Minors, Principal Minors

Let A ¼ ½aij  be a square matrix of order n. Consider any r rows and r columns of A. That is, consider any
set I ¼ ði1 ; i2 ; . . . ; ir Þ of r row indices and any set J ¼ ðj1 ; j2 ; . . . ; jr Þ of r column indices. Then I and J
deﬁne an r r submatrix of A, denoted by AðI; J Þ, obtained by deleting the rows and columns of A whose
subscripts do not belong to I or J , respectively. That is,
AðI; J Þ ¼ ½ast : s 2 I; t 2 J 
The determinant jAðI; J Þj is called a minor of A of order r and
ð1Þi1 þi2 þþir þj1 þj2 þþjr jAðI; J Þj
is the corresponding signed minor. (Note that a minor of order n  1 is a minor in the sense of Section
8.7, and the corresponding signed minor is a cofactor.) Furthermore, if I 0 and J 0 denote, respectively, the
remaining row and column indices, then
jAðI 0 ; J 0 Þj
denotes the complementary minor, and its sign (Problem 8.74) is the same sign as the minor.
EXAMPLE 8.13 Let A ¼ ½aij  be a 5-square matrix, and let I ¼ f1; 2; 4g and J ¼ f2; 3; 5g. Then
I 0 ¼ f3; 5g and J 0 ¼ f1; 4g, and the corresponding minor jMj and complementary minor jM 0 j are as
follows:

Because 1 þ 2 þ 4 þ 2 þ 3 þ 5 ¼ 17 is odd, jMj is the signed minor, and jM 0 j is the signed complementary
minor.

Principal Minors
A minor is principal if the row and column indices are the same, or equivalently, if the diagonal elements
of the minor come from the diagonal of the matrix. We note that the sign of a principal minor is always
þ1, because the sum of the row and identical column subscripts must always be even.

Determinants and Volume

Determinants are related to the notions of area and volume as follows. Let u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un be vectors in Rn .
Let S be the (solid) parallelopiped determined by the vectors; that is,
S ¼ fa1 u1 þ a2 u2 þ    þ an un : 0  ai  1 for i ¼ 1; . . . ; ng
(When n ¼ 2; S is a parallelogram.) Let V ðSÞ denote the volume of S (or area of S when n ¼ 2Þ. Then
V ðSÞ ¼ absolute value of det ðAÞ

Let u1 ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ, u2 ¼ ð1; 1; 1Þ, u3 ¼ ð0; 2; 3Þ. Find the volume V ðSÞ of the parallelopiped S in R3 (Fig. 8-2) determined by the three vectors.

Determinant of a Linear Operator

Let F be a linear operator on a vector space V with ﬁnite dimension. Let A be the matrix representation of
F relative to some basis S of V. Then we deﬁne the determinant of F, written detðFÞ, by
detðFÞ ¼ jAj
If B were another matrix representation of F relative to another basis S 0 of V, then A and B are similar
matrices (Theorem 6.7) and jBj ¼ jAj (Theorem 8.7). In other words, the above deﬁnition detðFÞ is
independent of the particular basis S of V. (We say that the deﬁnition is well deﬁned.)
The next theorem (to be proved in Problem 8.62) follows from analogous theorems on matrices.
THEOREM 8.13:

Let F and G be linear operators on a vector space V. Then
(i) detðF  GÞ ¼ detðFÞ detðGÞ.

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

Multilinearity and Determinants

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K. Let a ¼ V n ; that is, a consists of all the n-tuples
A ¼ ðA1 ; A2 ; . . . ; An Þ
where the Ai are vectors in V. The following deﬁnitions apply.
DEFINITION:

A function D: a ! K is said to be multilinear if it is linear in each component:
(i) If Ai ¼ B þ C, then
DðAÞ ¼ Dð. . . ; B þ C; . . .Þ ¼ Dð. . . ; B; . . . ; Þ þ Dð. . . ; C; . . .Þ
(ii) If Ai ¼ kB, where k 2 K, then
DðAÞ ¼ Dð. . . ; kB; . . .Þ ¼ kDð. . . ; B; . . .Þ
We also say n-linear for multilinear if there are n components.

DEFINITION:

A function D: a ! K is said to be alternating if DðAÞ ¼ 0 whenever A has two
identical elements:
DðA1 ; A2 ; . . . ; An Þ ¼ 0

whenever

Ai ¼ Aj ;

i 6¼ j

Now let M denote the set of all n-square matrices A over a ﬁeld K. We may view A as an n-tuple
consisting of its row vectors A1 ; A2 ; . . . ; An ; that is, we may view A in the form A ¼ ðA1 ; A2 ; . . . ; An Þ.
The following theorem (proved in Problem 8.37) characterizes the determinant function.
THEOREM 8.14:

There exists a unique function D: M ! K such that
(i) D is multilinear, (ii) D is alternating, (iii)

DðIÞ ¼ 1.

This function D is the determinant function; that is, DðAÞ ¼ jAj; for any matrix
A 2 M.

The symbolQ is used for a product of terms in the same way that the symbol

g ¼ gðx1 ; . . . ; x4 Þ ¼ ðx1  x2 Þðx1  x3 Þðx1  x4 Þðx2  x3 Þðx2  x4 Þðx3  x4 Þ

8.15. Let D be a 2-linear, alternating function. Show that DðA; BÞ ¼ DðB; AÞ.
Because D is alternating, DðA; AÞ ¼ 0, DðB; BÞ ¼ 0. Hence,
DðA þ B; A þ BÞ ¼ DðA; AÞ þ DðA; BÞ þ DðB; AÞ þ DðB; BÞ ¼ DðA; BÞ þ DðB; AÞ
However, DðA þ B; A þ BÞ ¼ 0. Hence, DðA; BÞ ¼ DðB; AÞ, as required.

Permutations
8.16. Determine the parity (sign) of the permutation s ¼ 364152.
Count the number of inversions. That is, for each element k, count the number of elements i in s such
that i > k and i precedes k in s. Namely,

8.18. Let s ¼ j1 j2 . . . jn be any permutation in Sn . Show that, for each inversion ði; kÞ where i > k but i
precedes k in s, there is a pair ði*; j*Þ such that
i* < k*
and
sði*Þ > sð j*Þ

and vice versa. Thus, s is even or odd according to whether there is an even or an odd number of
pairs satisfying (1).

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

Choose i* and k* so that sði*Þ ¼ i and sðk*Þ ¼ k. Then i > k if and only if sði*Þ > sðk*Þ, and i
precedes k in s if and only if i* < k*.

Q

and
sðgÞ ¼ ðxsðiÞ  xsðjÞ Þ
g ¼ gðx1 ; . . . ; xn Þ ¼ ðxi  xj Þ

i<j

(See Problem 8.14.) Show that sðgÞ ¼ g when s is an even permutation, and sðgÞ ¼ g when s is
an odd permutation. That is, sðgÞ ¼ ðsgn sÞg.
Because s is one-to-one and onto,
sðgÞ ¼

Q
ðxsðiÞ  xsð jÞ Þ ¼
i<j

Q

ðxi  xj Þ

i<j or i>j

Thus, sðgÞ or sðgÞ ¼ g according to whether there is an even or an odd number of terms of the form
xi  xj , where i > j. Note that for each pair ði; jÞ for which
i<j

and

sðiÞ > sð jÞ

there is a term ðxsðiÞ  xsð jÞ Þ in sðgÞ for which sðiÞ > sð jÞ. Because s is even if and only if there is an even
number of pairs satisfying (1), we have sðgÞ ¼ g if and only if s is even. Hence, sðgÞ ¼ g if and only if s
is odd.

8.20. Let s; t 2 Sn . Show that sgnðt  sÞ ¼ ðsgn tÞðsgn sÞ. Thus, the product of two even or two odd
permutations is even, and the product of an odd and an even permutation is odd.
Using Problem 8.19, we have
sgnðt  sÞ g ¼ ðt  sÞðgÞ ¼ tðsðgÞÞ ¼ tððsgn sÞgÞ ¼ ðsgn tÞðsgn sÞg
Accordingly, sgn ðt  sÞ ¼ ðsgn tÞðsgn sÞ.

8.21. Consider the permutation s ¼ j1 j2    jn . Show that sgn s1 ¼ sgn s and, for scalars aij ,
show that
aj1 1 aj2 2    ajn n ¼ a1k1 a2k2    ankn
where s1 ¼ k1 k2    kn .
We have s1  s ¼ e, the identity permutation. Because e is even, s1 and s are both even or both odd.
Hence sgn s1 ¼ sgn s.
Because s ¼ j1 j2    jn is a permutation, aj1 1 aj2 2    ajn n ¼ a1k1 a2k2    ankn . Then k1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn have the
property that
sðk1 Þ ¼ 1;

sðk2 Þ ¼ 2;

sðkn Þ ¼ n

Let t ¼ k1 k2    kn . Then, for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n,
ðs  tÞðiÞ ¼ sðtðiÞÞ ¼ sðki Þ ¼ i
Thus, s  t ¼ e, the identity permutation. Hence, t ¼ s1 .

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

However, as s runs through all the elements of Sn ; t ¼ s1 also runs through all the elements of Sn . Thus,
jAT j ¼ jAj.

8.23. Prove Theorem 8.3(i): If two rows (columns) of A are interchanged, then jBj ¼ jAj.
We prove the theorem for the case that two columns are interchanged. Let t be the transposition that
interchanges the two numbers corresponding to the two columns of A that are interchanged. If A ¼ ½aij  and
B ¼ ½bij , then bij ¼ aitðjÞ . Hence, for any permutation s,
b1sð1Þ b2sð2Þ    bnsðnÞ ¼ a1ðt  sÞð1Þ a2ðt  sÞð2Þ    anðt  sÞðnÞ
Thus,

P

Because the transposition t is an odd permutation, sgnðt  sÞ ¼ ðsgn tÞðsgn sÞ ¼ sgn s. Accordingly,
sgn s ¼ sgn ðt  sÞ; and so
P
½sgnðt  sÞa1ðt  sÞð1Þ a2ðt  sÞð2Þ    anðt  sÞðnÞ
jBj ¼ 
s2Sn

But as s runs through all the elements of Sn ; t  s also runs through all the elements of Sn : Hence, jBj ¼ jAj.

8.24. Prove Theorem 8.2.
(i)

If A has a row (column) of zeros, then jAj ¼ 0.

(ii) If A has two identical rows (columns), then jAj ¼ 0.
(iii) If A is triangular, then jAj ¼ product of diagonal elements. Thus, jIj ¼ 1.
(i) Each term in jAj contains a factor from every row, and so from the row of zeros. Thus, each term of jAj
is zero, and so jAj ¼ 0.
(ii) Suppose 1 þ 1 6¼ 0 in K. If we interchange the two identical rows of A, we still obtain the matrix A.
Hence, by Problem 8.23, jAj ¼ jAj, and so jAj ¼ 0.
Now suppose 1 þ 1 ¼ 0 in K. Then sgn s ¼ 1 for every s 2 Sn : Because A has two identical
rows, we can arrange the terms of A into pairs of equal terms. Because each pair is 0, the determinant
of A is zero.
(iii) Suppose A ¼ ½aij  is lower triangular; that is, the entries above the diagonal are all zero: aij ¼ 0
whenever i < j. Consider a term t of the determinant of A:
t ¼ ðsgn sÞa1i1 a2i2    anin ;

where

s ¼ i1 i2    i n

Suppose i1 6¼ 1. Then 1 < i1 and so a1i1 ¼ 0; hence, t ¼ 0: That is, each term for which i1 6¼ 1 is
zero.
Now suppose i1 ¼ 1 but i2 6¼ 2. Then 2 < i2 , and so a2i2 ¼ 0; hence, t ¼ 0. Thus, each term
for which i1 6¼ 1 or i2 6¼ 2 is zero.
Similarly, we obtain that each term for which i1 6¼ 1 or i2 6¼ 2 or . . . or in 6¼ n is zero.
Accordingly, jAj ¼ a11 a22    ann ¼ product of diagonal elements.

8.25. Prove Theorem 8.3: B is obtained from A by an elementary operation.
(i) If two rows (columns) of A were interchanged, then jBj ¼ jAj.
(ii) If a row (column) of A were multiplied by a scalar k, then jBj ¼ kjAj.
(iii) If a multiple of a row (column) of A were added to another row (column) of A; then jBj ¼ jAj.
(i) This result was proved in Problem 8.23.
(ii) If the jth row of A is multiplied by k, then every term in jAj is multiplied by k, and so jBj ¼ kjAj. That is,
jBj ¼

Suppose c times the kth row is added to the jth row of A. Using the symbol ^ to denote the jth position

The ﬁrst sum is the determinant of a matrix whose kth and jth rows are identical. Accordingly, by
Theorem 8.2(ii), the sum is zero. The second sum is the determinant of A. Thus, jBj ¼ c  0 þ jAj ¼ jAj.

8.26. Prove Lemma 8.6: Let E be an elementary matrix. Then jEAj ¼ jEjjAj.
Consider the elementary row operations: (i) Multiply a row by a constant k 6¼ 0,
(ii) Interchange two rows, (iii) Add a multiple of one row to another.
Let E1 ; E2 ; E3 be the corresponding elementary matrices That is, E1 ; E2 ; E3 are obtained by applying the
above operations to the identity matrix I. By Problem 8.25,
jE1 j ¼ kjIj ¼ k;

jE2 j ¼ jIj ¼ 1;

jE3 j ¼ jIj ¼ 1

Recall (Theorem 3.11) that Ei A is identical to the matrix obtained by applying the corresponding operation
to A. Thus, by Theorem 8.3, we obtain the following which proves our lemma:
jE1 Aj ¼ kjAj ¼ jE1 jjAj;

jE2 Aj ¼ jAj ¼ jE2 jjAj;

jE3 Aj ¼ jAj ¼ 1jAj ¼ jE3 jjAj

8.27. Suppose B is row equivalent to a square matrix A. Prove that jBj ¼ 0 if and only if jAj ¼ 0.
By Theorem 8.3, the effect of an elementary row operation is to change the sign of the determinant or to
multiply the determinant by a nonzero scalar. Hence, jBj ¼ 0 if and only if jAj ¼ 0.

8.28. Prove Theorem 8.5: Let A be an n-square matrix. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) A is invertible,

(ii) AX ¼ 0 has only the zero solution,

(iii) detðAÞ 6¼ 0.

The proof is by the Gaussian algorithm. If A is invertible, it is row equivalent to I. But jIj 6¼ 0. Hence,
by Problem 8.27, jAj 6¼ 0. If A is not invertible, it is row equivalent to a matrix with a zero row. Hence,
detðAÞ ¼ 0. Thus, (i) and (iii) are equivalent.
If AX ¼ 0 has only the solution X ¼ 0, then A is row equivalent to I and A is invertible. Conversely, if
A is invertible with inverse A1 , then
X ¼ IX ¼ ðA1 AÞX ¼ A1 ðAX Þ ¼ A1 0 ¼ 0
is the only solution of AX ¼ 0. Thus, (i) and (ii) are equivalent.

8.29. Prove Theorem 8.4: jABj ¼ jAjjBj.
If A is singular, then AB is also singular, and so jABj ¼ 0 ¼ jAjjBj. On the other hand, if A is
nonsingular, then A ¼ En    E2 E1 , a product of elementary matrices. Then, Lemma 8.6 and induction yields
jABj ¼ jEn    E2 E1 Bj ¼ jEn j    jE2 jjE1 jjBj ¼ jAjjBj

8.30. Suppose P is invertible. Prove that jP1 j ¼ jPj1 .
P1 P ¼ I: Hence; 1 ¼ jIj ¼ jP1 Pj ¼ jP1 jjPj; and so jP1 j ¼ jPj1 :

8.31. Prove Theorem 8.7: Suppose A and B are similar matrices. Then jAj ¼ jBj.
Because A and B are similar, there exists an invertible matrix P such that B ¼ P1 AP. Therefore, using
Problem 8.30, we get jBj ¼ jP1 APj ¼ jP1 jjAjjPj ¼ jAjjP1 jjP ¼ jAj.
We remark that although the matrices P1 and A may not commute, their determinants jP1 j and jAj do
commute, because they are scalars in the ﬁeld K.

8.32. Prove Theorem 8.8 (Laplace): Let A ¼ ½aij , and let Aij denote the cofactor of aij . Then, for any i or j
jAj ¼ ai1 Ai1 þ    þ ain Ain

and

jAj ¼ a1j A1j þ    þ anj Anj

285

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

Because jAj ¼ jAT j, we need only prove one of the expansions, say, the ﬁrst one in terms of rows of A.
Each term in jAj contains one and only one entry of the ith row ðai1 ; ai2 ; . . . ; ain Þ of A. Hence, we can write
jAj in the form
jAj ¼ ai1 A*i1 þ ai2 A*i2 þ    þ ain A*in
(Note that A*ij is a sum of terms involving no entry of the ith row of A.) Thus, the theorem is proved if we can
show that
A*ij ¼ Aij ¼ ð1Þiþj jMij j
where Mij is the matrix obtained by deleting the row and column containing the entry aij : (Historically, the
expression A*ij was deﬁned as the cofactor of aij , and so the theorem reduces to showing that the two
deﬁnitions of the cofactor are equivalent.)
First we consider the case that i ¼ n, j ¼ n. Then the sum of terms in jAj containing ann is
P
ann A*nn ¼ ann ðsgn sÞa1sð1Þ a2sð2Þ    an1;sðn1Þ
s

where we sum over all permutations s 2 Sn for which sðnÞ ¼ n. However, this is equivalent (Prove!) to
summing over all permutations of f1; . . . ; n  1g. Thus, A*nn ¼ jMnn j ¼ ð1Þnþn jMnn j.
Now we consider any i and j. We interchange the ith row with each succeeding row until it is last, and
we interchange the jth column with each succeeding column until it is last. Note that the determinant jMij j is
not affected, because the relative positions of the other rows and columns are not affected by these
interchanges. However, the ‘‘sign’’ of jAj and of A*ij is changed n  1 and then n  j times. Accordingly,
A*ij ¼ ð1Þniþnj jMij j ¼ ð1Þiþj jMij j

8.33. Let A ¼ ½aij  and let B be the matrix obtained from A by replacing the ith row of A by the row
vector ðbi1 ; . . . ; bin Þ. Show that
jBj ¼ bi1 Ai1 þ bi2 Ai2 þ    þ bin Ain
Furthermore, show that, for j 6¼ i,
aj1 Ai1 þ aj2 Ai2 þ    þ ajn Ain ¼ 0

and

a1j A1i þ a2j A2i þ    þ anj Ani ¼ 0

Let B ¼ ½bij . By Theorem 8.8,
jBj ¼ bi1 Bi1 þ bi2 Bi2 þ    þ bin Bin
Because Bij does not depend on the ith row of B; we get Bij ¼ Aij for j ¼ 1; . . . ; n. Hence,
jBj ¼ bi1 Ai1 þ bi2 Ai2 þ    þ bin Ain
0

Now let A be obtained from A by replacing the ith row of A by the jth row of A. Because A0 has two
identical rows, jA0 j ¼ 0. Thus, by the above result,
jA0 j ¼ aj1 Ai1 þ aj2 Ai2 þ    þ ajn Ain ¼ 0
Using jAT j ¼ jAj, we also obtain that a1j A1i þ a2j A2i þ    þ anj Ani ¼ 0.

8.34. Prove Theorem 8.9: Aðadj AÞ ¼ ðadj AÞA ¼ jAjI.
Let A ¼ ½aij  and let Aðadj AÞ ¼ ½bij . The ith row of A is
ðai1 ; ai2 ; . . . ; ain Þ

ð1Þ

Because adj A is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors, the jth column of adj A is the tranpose of the
cofactors of the jth row of A:
ðAj ; Aj2 ; . . . ; Ajn ÞT
Now bij ; the ij entry in Aðadj AÞ, is obtained by multiplying expressions (1) and (2):
bij ¼ ai1 Aj1 þ ai2 Aj2 þ    þ ain Ajn

ð2Þ

286

CHAPTER 8 Determinants

By Theorem 8.8 and Problem 8.33,
bij ¼

jAj if i ¼ j
0 if i 6¼ j

Accordingly, Aðadj AÞ is the diagonal matrix with each diagonal element jAj. In other words,
Aðadj AÞ ¼ jAjI. Similarly, ðadj AÞA ¼ jAjI.

8.35. Prove Theorem 8.10 (Cramer’s rule): The (square) system AX ¼ B has a unique solution if and
only if D 6¼ 0. In this case, xi ¼ Ni =D for each i.
By previous results, AX ¼ B has a unique solution if and only if A is invertible, and A is invertible if and
only if D ¼ jAj 6¼ 0.
Now suppose D 6¼ 0. By Theorem 8.9, A1 ¼ ð1=DÞðadj AÞ. Multiplying AX ¼ B by A1 , we obtain
X ¼ A1 AX ¼ ð1=DÞðadj AÞB

ð1Þ
T

Note that the ith row of ð1=DÞðadj AÞ is ð1=DÞðA1i ; A2i ; . . . ; Ani Þ. If B ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; . . . ; bn Þ , then, by (1),
xi ¼ ð1=DÞðb1 A1i þ b2 A2i þ    þ bn Ani Þ
However, as in Problem 8.33, b1 A1i þ b2 A2i þ    þ bn Ani ¼ Ni , the determinant of the matrix obtained by
replacing the ith column of A by the column vector B. Thus, xi ¼ ð1=DÞNi , as required.

8.36. Prove Theorem 8.12: Suppose M is an upper (lower) triangular block matrix with diagonal blocks
A1 ; A2 ; . . . ; An . Then
detðM Þ ¼ detðA1 Þ detðA2 Þ    detðAn Þ
We need only prove the theorem for n ¼ 2—that is, when M is a square matrix of the form


A C
M¼
. The proof of the general theorem follows easily by induction.
0 B
Suppose A ¼ ½aij  is r-square, B ¼ ½bij  is s-square, and M ¼ ½mij  is n-square, where n ¼ r þ s. By
deﬁnition,
P
ðsgn sÞm1sð1Þ m2sð2Þ    mnsðnÞ
detðM Þ ¼
s2Sn

If i > r and j  r, then mij ¼ 0. Thus, we need only consider those permutations s such that
sfr þ 1; r þ 2; . . . ; r þ sg ¼ fr þ 1; r þ 2; . . . ; r þ sg

and

sf1; 2; . . . ; rg ¼ f1; 2; . . . ; rg

Let s1 ðkÞ ¼ sðkÞ for k  r, and let s2 ðkÞ ¼ sðr þ kÞ  r for k  s. Then
ðsgn sÞm1sð1Þ m2sð2Þ    mnsðnÞ ¼ ðsgn s1 Þa1s1 ð1Þ a2s1 ð2Þ    ars1 ðrÞ ðsgn s2 Þb1s2 ð1Þ b2s2 ð2Þ    bss2 ðsÞ
which implies detðMÞ ¼ detðAÞ detðBÞ.

8.37. Prove Theorem 8.14: There exists a unique function D : M ! K such that
(i) D is multilinear, (ii) D is alternating, (iii) DðIÞ ¼ 1.
This function D is the determinant function; that is, DðAÞ ¼ jAj.
Let D be the determinant function, DðAÞ ¼ jAj. We must show that D satisﬁes (i), (ii), and (iii), and that
D is the only function satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii).
By Theorem 8.2, D satisﬁes (ii) and (iii). Hence, we show that it is multilinear. Suppose the ith row of
A ¼ ½aij  has the form ðbi1 þ ci1 ; bi2 þ ci2 ; . . . ; bin þ cin Þ. Then
DðAÞ ¼ DðA1 ; . . . ; Bi þ Ci ; . . . ; An Þ

CHAPTER 8 Determinants
Also, by Theorem 8.3(ii),
DðA1 ; . . . ; kAi ; . . . ; An Þ ¼ kDðA1 ; . . . ; Ai ; . . . ; An Þ

Thus, D is multilinear—D satisﬁes (i).
We next must prove the uniqueness of D. Suppose D satisﬁes (i), (ii), and (iii). If fe1 ; . . . ; en g is the
usual basis of K n , then, by (iii), Dðe1 ; e2 ; . . . ; en Þ ¼ DðIÞ ¼ 1. Using (ii), we also have that
Dðei1 ; ei2 ; . . . ; ein Þ ¼ sgn s;

where

s ¼ i1 i2    in

ð1Þ

Now suppose A ¼ ½aij . Observe that the kth row Ak of A is
Ak ¼ ðak1 ; ak2 ; . . . ; akn Þ ¼ ak1 e1 þ ak2 e2 þ    þ akn en
Thus,
DðAÞ ¼ Dða11 e1 þ    þ a1n en ; a21 e1 þ    þ a2n en ; . . . ; an1 e1 þ    þ ann en Þ
Using the multilinearity of D, we can write DðAÞ as a sum of terms of the form
DðAÞ ¼

ð2Þ

where the sum is summed over all sequences i1 i2 . . . in , where ik 2 f1; . . . ; ng. If two of the indices are equal,
say ij ¼ ik but j 6¼ k, then, by (ii),
Dðei1 ; ei2 ; . . . ; ein Þ ¼ 0
Accordingly, the sum in (2) need only be summed over all permutations s ¼ i1 i2    in . Using (1), we ﬁnally
have that
P
DðAÞ ¼ ða1i1 a2i2    anin ÞDðei1 ; ei2 ; . . . ; ein Þ
s
P
where
s ¼ i1 i2    in

Hence, D is the determinant function, and so the theorem is proved.

Diagonalization:
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
9.1

Introduction

The ideas in this chapter can be discussed from two points of view.

Matrix Point of View
Suppose an n-square matrix A is given. The matrix A is said to be diagonalizable if there exists a
nonsingular matrix P such that
B ¼ P1 AP
is diagonal. This chapter discusses the diagonalization of a matrix A. In particular, an algorithm is given
to ﬁnd the matrix P when it exists.

Linear Operator Point of View
Suppose a linear operator T : V ! V is given. The linear operator T is said to be diagonalizable if there
exists a basis S of V such that the matrix representation of T relative to the basis S is a diagonal matrix D.
This chapter discusses conditions under which the linear operator T is diagonalizable.

Equivalence of the Two Points of View
The above two concepts are essentially the same. Speciﬁcally, a square matrix A may be viewed as a
linear operator F deﬁned by
FðX Þ ¼ AX
where X is a column vector, and B ¼ P1 AP represents F relative to a new coordinate system (basis)
S whose elements are the columns of P. On the other hand, any linear operator T can be represented by a
matrix A relative to one basis and, when a second basis is chosen, T is represented by the matrix
B ¼ P1 AP
where P is the change-of-basis matrix.
Most theorems will be stated in two ways: one in terms of matrices A and again in terms of linear
mappings T .

Role of Underlying Field K
The underlying number ﬁeld K did not play any special role in our previous discussions on vector spaces
and linear mappings. However, the diagonalization of a matrix A or a linear operator T will depend on the

292

293

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

roots of a polynomial DðtÞ over K, and these roots do depend on K. For example, suppose DðtÞ ¼ t2 þ 1.
Then DðtÞ has no roots if K ¼ R, the real ﬁeld; but DðtÞ has roots i if K ¼ C, the complex ﬁeld.
Furthermore, ﬁnding the roots of a polynomial with degree greater than two is a subject unto itself
(frequently discussed in numerical analysis courses). Accordingly, our examples will usually lead to
those polynomials DðtÞ whose roots can be easily determined.

9.2

Polynomials of Matrices

Consider a polynomial f ðtÞ ¼ an tn þ    þ a1 t þ a0 over a ﬁeld K. Recall (Section 2.8) that if A is any
square matrix, then we deﬁne
f ðAÞ ¼ an An þ    þ a1 A þ a0 I
where I is the identity matrix. In particular, we say that A is a root of f ðtÞ if f ðAÞ ¼ 0, the zero matrix.

Thus, A is a zero of gðtÞ.

The following theorem (proved in Problem 9.7) applies.
THEOREM 9.1:

Let f and g be polynomials. For any square matrix A and scalar k,
(i) ð f þ gÞðAÞ ¼ f ðAÞ þ gðAÞ
(ii) ð fgÞðAÞ ¼ f ðAÞgðAÞ

(iii) ðkf ÞðAÞ ¼ kf ðAÞ
(iv) f ðAÞgðAÞ ¼ gðAÞ f ðAÞ:

Observe that (iv) tells us that any two polynomials in A commute.

Matrices and Linear Operators
Now suppose that T : V ! V is a linear operator on a vector space V . Powers of T are deﬁned by the
composition operation:
T 2 ¼ T  T;

T 3 ¼ T 2  T;

...

Also, for any polynomial f ðtÞ ¼ an tn þ    þ a1 t þ a0 , we deﬁne f ðT Þ in the same way as we did for
matrices:
f ðT Þ ¼ an T n þ    þ a1 T þ a0 I
where I is now the identity mapping. We also say that T is a zero or root of f ðtÞ if f ðT Þ ¼ 0; the zero
mapping. We note that the relations in Theorem 9.1 hold for linear operators as they do for matrices.
Remark: Suppose A is a matrix representation of a linear operator T . Then f ðAÞ is the matrix
representation of f ðTÞ, and, in particular, f ðT Þ ¼ 0 if and only if f ðAÞ ¼ 0.

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Characteristic Polynomial, Cayley–Hamilton Theorem

Let A ¼ ½aij  be an n-square matrix. The matrix M ¼ A  tIn , where In is the n-square identity matrix and
t is an indeterminate, may be obtained by subtracting t down the diagonal of A. The negative of M is the
matrix tIn  A, and its determinant
DðtÞ ¼ detðtIn  AÞ ¼ ð1Þn detðA  tIn Þ
which is a polynomial in t of degree n and is called the characteristic polynomial of A.
We state an important theorem in linear algebra (proved in Problem 9.8).
THEOREM 9.2:

(Cayley–Hamilton) Every matrix A is a root of its characteristic polynomial.

Remark: Suppose A ¼ ½aij  is a triangular matrix. Then tI  A is a triangular matrix with diagonal
entries t  aii ; hence,
DðtÞ ¼ detðtI  AÞ ¼ ðt  a11 Þðt  a22 Þ    ðt  ann Þ
Observe that the roots of DðtÞ are the diagonal elements of A.

Now suppose A and B are similar matrices, say B ¼ P1 AP, where P is invertible. We show that A
and B have the same characteristic polynomial. Using tI ¼ P1 tIP, we have
DB ðtÞ ¼ detðtI  BÞ ¼ detðtI  P1 APÞ ¼ detðP1 tIP  P1 APÞ
¼ det½P1 ðtI  AÞP ¼ detðP1 Þ detðtI  AÞ detðPÞ
Using the fact that determinants are scalars and commute and that detðP1 Þ detðPÞ ¼ 1, we ﬁnally obtain
DB ðtÞ ¼ detðtI  AÞ ¼ DA ðtÞ
Thus, we have proved the following theorem.
THEOREM 9.3:

Similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.

alternating signs, as follows:
S1 ¼ trðAÞ;

S2 ¼ A11 þ A22 þ A33 ;

S3 ¼ detðAÞ

We note that each Sk is the sum of all principal minors of A of order k.
The next theorem, whose proof lies beyond the scope of this text, tells us that this result is true in
general.
THEOREM 9.4:

Let A be an n-square matrix. Then its characteristic polynomial is
DðtÞ ¼ tn  S1 tn1 þ S2 tn2 þ    þ ð1Þn Sn
where Sk is the sum of the principal minors of order k.

Characteristic Polynomial of a Linear Operator
Now suppose T: V ! V is a linear operator on a vector space V of ﬁnite dimension. We deﬁne the
characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T to be the characteristic polynomial of any matrix representation of T .
Recall that if A and B are matrix representations of T , then B ¼ P1 AP, where P is a change-of-basis
matrix. Thus, A and B are similar, and by Theorem 9.3, A and B have the same characteristic polynomial.
Accordingly, the characteristic polynomial of T is independent of the particular basis in which the matrix
representation of T is computed.
Because f ðTÞ ¼ 0 if and only if f ðAÞ ¼ 0, where f ðtÞ is any polynomial and A is any matrix
representation of T , we have the following analogous theorem for linear operators.
THEOREM 9.20 :

(Cayley–Hamilton) A linear operator T is a zero of its characteristic polynomial.

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Diagonalization, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Let A be any n-square matrix. Then A can be represented by (or is similar to) a diagonal matrix
D ¼ diagðk1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn Þ if and only if there exists a basis S consisting of (column) vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un
such that
Au1 ¼ k1 u1
Au2 ¼
k2 u2
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
kn un
Aun ¼
In such a case, A is said to be diagonizable. Furthermore, D ¼ P1 AP, where P is the nonsingular matrix
whose columns are, respectively, the basis vectors u1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un .
The above observation leads us to the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

Let A be any square matrix. A scalar l is called an eigenvalue of A if there exists a
nonzero (column) vector v such that
Av ¼ lv
Any vector satisfying this relation is called an eigenvector of A belonging to the
eigenvalue l.

We note that each scalar multiple kv of an eigenvector v belonging to l is also such an eigenvector,
because
AðkvÞ ¼ kðAvÞ ¼ kðlvÞ ¼ lðkvÞ
The set El of all such eigenvectors is a subspace of V (Problem 9.19), called the eigenspace of l. (If
dim El ¼ 1, then El is called an eigenline and l is called a scaling factor.)
The terms characteristic value and characteristic vector (or proper value and proper vector) are
sometimes used instead of eigenvalue and eigenvector.
The above observation and deﬁnitions give us the following theorem.
THEOREM 9.5:

An n-square matrix A is similar to a diagonal matrix D if and only if A has n linearly
independent eigenvectors. In this case, the diagonal elements of D are the corresponding
eigenvalues and D ¼ P1 AP, where P is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors.

Suppose a matrix A can be diagonalized as above, say P1 AP ¼ D, where D is diagonal. Then A has
the extremely useful diagonal factorization:
A ¼ PDP1
Using this factorization, the algebra of A reduces to the algebra of the diagonal matrix D, which can be
easily calculated. Speciﬁcally, suppose D ¼ diagðk1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn Þ. Then
Am ¼ ðPDP1 Þm ¼ PDm P1 ¼ P diagðk1m ; . . . ; knm ÞP1
More generally, for any polynomial f ðtÞ,
f ðAÞ ¼ f ðPDP1 Þ ¼ Pf ðDÞP1 ¼ P diagð f ðk1 Þ; f ðk2 Þ; . . . ; f ðkn ÞÞP1
Furthermore, if the diagonal entries of D are nonnegative, let
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
B ¼ P diagð k1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn Þ P1
Then B is a nonnegative square root of A; that is, B2 ¼ A and the eigenvalues of B are nonnegative.

Properties of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Example 9.5 indicates the advantages of a diagonal representation (factorization) of a square matrix. In
the following theorem (proved in Problem 9.20), we list properties that help us to ﬁnd such a
representation.

298
THEOREM 9.6:

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Let A be a square matrix. Then the following are equivalent.
(i)

A scalar l is an eigenvalue of A.

(ii)

The matrix M ¼ A  lI is singular.

(iii)

The scalar l is a root of the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of A.

The eigenspace El of an eigenvalue l is the solution space of the homogeneous system MX ¼ 0,
where M ¼ A  lI; that is, M is obtained by subtracting l down the diagonal of A.
Some matrices have no eigenvalues and hence no eigenvectors. However, using Theorem 9.6 and the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (every polynomial over the complex ﬁeld C has a root), we obtain the
following result.
THEOREM 9.7:

Let A be a square matrix over the complex ﬁeld C. Then A has at least one eigenvalue.

The following theorems will be used subsequently. (The theorem equivalent to Theorem 9.8 for linear
operators is proved in Problem 9.21, and Theorem 9.9 is proved in Problem 9.22.)
THEOREM 9.8:

Suppose v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are nonzero eigenvectors of a matrix A belonging to distinct
eigenvalues l1 ; l2 ; . . . ; ln . Then v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are linearly independent.

THEOREM 9.9:

Suppose the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of an n-square matrix A is a product of n
distinct factors, say, DðtÞ ¼ ðt  a1 Þðt  a2 Þ    ðt  an Þ. Then A is similar to the
diagonal matrix D ¼ diagða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ.

If l is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, then the algebraic multiplicity of l is deﬁned to be the multiplicity
of l as a root of the characteristic polynomial of A, and the geometric multiplicity of l is deﬁned to be the
dimension of its eigenspace, dim El . The following theorem (whose equivalent for linear operators is
proved in Problem 9.23) holds.
THEOREM 9.10:

The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue l of a matrix A does not exceed its
algebraic multiplicity.

Diagonalization of Linear Operators
Consider a linear operator T : V ! V . Then T is said to be diagonalizable if it can be represented by a
diagonal matrix D. Thus, T is diagonalizable if and only if there exists a basis S ¼ fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g of V
for which
T ðu1 Þ ¼ k1 u1
T ðu2 Þ ¼
k2 u2
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
T ðun Þ ¼
kn un
In such a case, T is represented by the diagonal matrix
D ¼ diagðk1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kn Þ
relative to the basis S.
The above observation leads us to the following deﬁnitions and theorems, which are analogous to the
deﬁnitions and theorems for matrices discussed above.
DEFINITION:

Let T be a linear operator. A scalar l is called an eigenvalue of T if there exists a
nonzero vector v such that T ðvÞ ¼ lv.
Every vector satisfying this relation is called an eigenvector of T belonging to the
eigenvalue l.

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

299

The set El of all eigenvectors belonging to an eigenvalue l is a subspace of V , called the
eigenspace of l. (Alternatively, l is an eigenvalue of T if lI  T is singular, and, in this case, El is the
kernel of lI  T .) The algebraic and geometric multiplicities of an eigenvalue l of a linear operator T are
deﬁned in the same way as those of an eigenvalue of a matrix A.
The following theorems apply to a linear operator T on a vector space V of ﬁnite dimension.
THEOREM 9.50 :

T can be represented by a diagonal matrix D if and only if there exists a basis S of V
consisting of eigenvectors of T . In this case, the diagonal elements of D are the
corresponding eigenvalues.

THEOREM 9.60 :

Let T be a linear operator. Then the following are equivalent:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

A scalar l is an eigenvalue of T .
The linear operator lI  T is singular.
The scalar l is a root of the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T .

THEOREM 9.70 :

Suppose V is a complex vector space. Then T has at least one eigenvalue.

THEOREM 9.80 :

Suppose v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are nonzero eigenvectors of a linear operator T belonging to
distinct eigenvalues l1 ; l2 ; . . . ; ln . Then v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are linearly independent.

THEOREM 9.90 :

Suppose the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T is a product of n distinct factors, say,
DðtÞ ¼ ðt  a1 Þðt  a2 Þ    ðt  an Þ. Then T can be represented by the diagonal
matrix D ¼ diagða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ.

THEOREM 9.100 :

The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue l of T does not exceed its algebraic
multiplicity.

Remark: The following theorem reduces the investigation of the diagonalization of a linear
operator T to the diagonalization of a matrix A.
THEOREM 9.11:

9.5

Suppose A is a matrix representation of T . Then T is diagonalizable if and only if A
is diagonalizable.

Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, Diagonalizing Matrices

This section gives an algorithm for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given square matrix A
and for determining whether or not a nonsingular matrix P exists such that P1 AP is diagonal.
ALGORITHM 9.1:

(Diagonalization Algorithm) The input is an n-square matrix A.

Step 1. Find the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of A.
Step 2. Find the roots of DðtÞ to obtain the eigenvalues of A.
Step 3. Repeat (a) and (b) for each eigenvalue l of A.
(a) Form the matrix M ¼ A  lI by subtracting l down the diagonal of A.
(b) Find a basis for the solution space of the homogeneous system MX ¼ 0. (These basis
vectors are linearly independent eigenvectors of A belonging to l.)

Step 4. Consider the collection S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v m g of all eigenvectors obtained in Step 3.

(b) If m ¼ n, then A is diagonalizable. Speciﬁcally, let P be the matrix whose columns are the

(b) A is a matrix over the complex ﬁeld C. Then DðtÞ ¼ ðt  iÞðt þ iÞ has two roots, i and i. Thus, A has two

Diagonalizing Real Symmetric Matrices and Quadratic Forms

There are many real matrices A that are not diagonalizable. In fact, some real matrices may not have any
(real) eigenvalues. However, if A is a real symmetric matrix, then these problems do not exist. Namely,
we have the following theorems.
THEOREM 9.12:

Let A be a real symmetric matrix. Then each root l of its characteristic polynomial is
real.

THEOREM 9.13:

Let A be a real symmetric matrix. Suppose u and v are eigenvectors of A belonging
to distinct eigenvalues l1 and l2 . Then u and v are orthogonal, that; is, hu; vi ¼ 0.

The above two theorems give us the following fundamental result.
THEOREM 9.14:

Let A be a real symmetric matrix. Then there exists an orthogonal matrix P such that
D ¼ P1 AP is diagonal.

The orthogonal matrix P is obtained by normalizing a basis of orthogonal eigenvectors of A as
illustrated below. In such a case, we say that A is ‘‘orthogonally diagonalizable.’’


EXAMPLE 9.9

Let A ¼

First we ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of A. We have

so

DðtÞ ¼ t2  7t þ 6 ¼ ðt  6Þðt  1Þ

orthogonal matrix P such that P1 AP is diagonal.
ALGORITHM 9.2:

(Orthogonal Diagonalization Algorithm) The input is a real symmetric matrix A.

Step 1. Find the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of A.
Step 2. Find the eigenvalues of A, which are the roots of DðtÞ.
Step 3. For each eigenvalue l of A in Step 2, ﬁnd an orthogonal basis of its eigenspace.
Step 4. Normalize all eigenvectors in Step 3, which then forms an orthonormal basis of Rn .
Step 5. Let P be the matrix whose columns are the normalized eigenvectors in Step 4.

qðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ ¼

dij xi xj ;

where

ci ; dij 2 R

Then q is called a quadratic form. If there are no cross-product terms xi xj (i.e., all dij ¼ 0), then q is said
to be diagonal.
The above quadratic form q determines a real symmetric matrix A ¼ ½aij , where aii ¼ ci and
aij ¼ aji ¼ 12 dij . Namely, q can be written in the matrix form
qðX Þ ¼ X T AX
where X ¼ ½x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn T is the column vector of the variables. Furthermore, suppose X ¼ PY is a
linear substitution of the variables. Then substitution in the quadratic form yields
qðY Þ ¼ ðPY ÞT AðPY Þ ¼ Y T ðPT APÞY
Thus, PT AP is the matrix representation of q in the new variables.
We seek an orthogonal matrix P such that the orthogonal substitution X ¼ PY yields a diagonal
quadratic form for which PT AP is diagonal. Because P is orthogonal, PT ¼ P1 , and hence,
PT AP ¼ P1 AP. The above theory yields such an orthogonal matrix P.

Minimal Polynomial

Let A be any square matrix. Let J ðAÞ denote the collection of all polynomials f ðtÞ for which A is a root—
that is, for which f ðAÞ ¼ 0. The set J ðAÞ is not empty, because the Cayley–Hamilton Theorem 9.1 tells us
that the characteristic polynomial DA ðtÞ of A belongs to J ðAÞ. Let mðtÞ denote the monic polynomial of
lowest degree in J ðAÞ. (Such a polynomial mðtÞ exists and is unique.) We call mðtÞ the minimal
polynomial of the matrix A.
Remark: A polynomial f ðtÞ 6¼ 0 is monic if its leading coefﬁcient equals one.
The following theorem (proved in Problem 9.33) holds.
THEOREM 9.15:

The minimal polynomial mðtÞ of a matrix (linear operator) A divides every
polynomial that has A as a zero. In particular, mðtÞ divides the characteristic
polynomial DðtÞ of A.

There is an even stronger relationship between mðtÞ and DðtÞ.
THEOREM 9.16:

The characteristic polynomial DðtÞ and the minimal polynomial mðtÞ of a matrix A
have the same irreducible factors.

This theorem (proved in Problem 9.35) does not say that mðtÞ ¼ DðtÞ, only that any irreducible factor
of one must divide the other. In particular, because a linear factor is irreducible, mðtÞ and DðtÞ have the
same linear factors. Hence, they have the same roots. Thus, we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 9.17:

A scalar l is an eigenvalue of the matrix A if and only if l is a root of the minimal
polynomial of A.

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

The minimal polynomial mðtÞ must divide DðtÞ. Also, each irreducible factor of DðtÞ (i.e., t  1 and t  3) must
also be a factor of mðtÞ. Thus, mðtÞ is exactly one of the following:

f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  3Þðt  1Þ

or

gðtÞ ¼ ðt  3Þðt  1Þ2

We know, by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, that gðAÞ ¼ DðAÞ ¼ 0. Hence, we need only test f ðtÞ. We have

The ﬁrst matrix, called a Jordan Block, has l’s on the diagonal, 1’s on the superdiagonal (consisting of the
entries above the diagonal entries), and 0’s elsewhere. The second matrix A has l’s on the diagonal, a’s on the
superdiagonal, and 0’s elsewhere. [Thus, A is a generalization of J ðl; rÞ.] One can show that

f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  lÞr
is both the characteristic and minimal polynomial of both J ðl; rÞ and A.
(b) Consider an arbitrary monic polynomial:

f ðtÞ ¼ tn þ an1 tn1 þ    þ a1 t þ a0
Let Cð f Þ be the n-square matrix with 1’s on the subdiagonal (consisting of the entries below the diagonal
entries), the negatives of the coefﬁcients in the last column, and 0’s elsewhere as follows:

Then Cð f Þ is called the companion matrix of the polynomial f ðtÞ. Moreover, the minimal polynomial mðtÞ and
the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of the companion matrix Cð f Þ are both equal to the original polynomial f ðtÞ.

Minimal Polynomial of a Linear Operator
The minimal polynomial mðtÞ of a linear operator T is deﬁned to be the monic polynomial of lowest
degree for which T is a root. However, for any polynomial f ðtÞ, we have
f ðT Þ ¼ 0

if and only if

f ðAÞ ¼ 0

where A is any matrix representation of T . Accordingly, T and A have the same minimal polynomials.
Thus, the above theorems on the minimal polynomial of a matrix also hold for the minimal polynomial of
a linear operator. That is, we have the following theorems.
THEOREM 9.150 :

The minimal polynomial mðtÞ of a linear operator T divides every polynomial that
has T as a root. In particular, mðtÞ divides the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T .

THEOREM 9.160 :

By induction, we obtain the following useful result.
THEOREM 9.18:

Suppose M is a block triangular matrix with diagonal blocks A1 ; A2 ; . . . ; Ar . Then the

Minimal Polynomial and Block Diagonal Matrices
The following theorem (proved in Problem 9.36) holds.
THEOREM 9.19:

Suppose M is a block diagonal matrix with diagonal blocks A1 ; A2 ; . . . ; Ar . Then the
minimal polynomial of M is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the
minimal polynomials of the diagonal blocks Ai .

Remark: We emphasize that this theorem applies to block diagonal matrices, whereas the
analogous Theorem 9.18 on characteristic polynomials applies to block triangular matrices.

Then DðtÞ is the product of the characterization polynomials D1 ðtÞ, D2 ðtÞ, D3 ðtÞ of A1 ; A2 ; A3 , respectively.
One can show that

D2 ðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  7Þ;

D3 ðtÞ ¼ t  7

Thus, DðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ3 ðt  7Þ2 . [As expected, deg DðtÞ ¼ 5:
The minimal polynomials m1 ðtÞ, m2 ðtÞ, m3 ðtÞ of the diagonal blocks A1 ; A2 ; A3 , respectively, are equal to the
characteristic polynomials; that is,

m1 ðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ2 ;

m2 ðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  7Þ;

m3 ðtÞ ¼ t  7

Prove the Cayley–Hamilton Theorem 9.2: Every matrix A is a root of its characterstic polynomial
DðtÞ.
Let A be an arbitrary n-square matrix and let DðtÞ be its characteristic polynomial, say,
DðtÞ ¼ jtI  Aj ¼ tn þ an1 tn1 þ    þ a1 t þ a0
Now let BðtÞ denote the classical adjoint of the matrix tI  A. The elements of BðtÞ are cofactors of the
matrix tI  A and hence are polynomials in t of degree not exceeding n  1. Thus,
BðtÞ ¼ Bn1 tn1 þ    þ B1 t þ B0
where the Bi are n-square matrices over K which are independent of t. By the fundamental property of the
classical adjoint (Theorem 8.9), ðtI  AÞBðtÞ ¼ jtI  AjI, or
ðtI  AÞðBn1 tn1 þ    þ B1 t þ B0 Þ ¼ ðtn þ an1 tn1 þ    þ a1 t þ a0 ÞI
Removing the parentheses and equating corresponding powers of t yields
Bn1 ¼ I;

Bn2  ABn1 ¼ an1 I;

...;

B0  AB1 ¼ a1 I;

AB0 ¼ a0 I

Multiplying the above equations by An ; An1 ; . . . ; A; I, respectively, yields
An Bn1 ¼ An I;

An1 Bn2  An Bn1 ¼ an1 An1 ;

...;

AB0  A2 B1 ¼ a1 A;

AB0 ¼ a0 I

Adding the above matrix equations yields 0 on the left-hand side and DðAÞ on the right-hand side; that is,
0 ¼ An þ an1 An1 þ    þ a1 A þ a0 I
Therefore, DðAÞ ¼ 0, which is the Cayley–Hamilton theorem.

Find, for each matrix, all eigenvalues and a maximum set S of linearly independent eigenvectors.
Which of these linear operators are diagonalizable—that is, which can be represented by a
diagonal matrix?
(a) First ﬁnd DðtÞ ¼ t2  3t  28 ¼ ðt  7Þðt þ 4Þ. The roots l ¼ 7 and l ¼ 4 are the eigenvalues of A.

Here v 2 ¼ ð2; 3Þ is a nonzero solution.
Then S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 g ¼ fð3; 1Þ; ð2; 3Þg is a maximal set of linearly independent eigenvectors. Because S is
a basis of R2 , A is diagonalizable. Using the basis S, A is represented by the diagonal matrix D ¼ diagð7; 4Þ.
(b) First ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ ¼ t2 þ 1. There are no real roots. Thus B, a real matrix
representing a linear transformation on R2 , has no eigenvalues and no eigenvectors. Hence, in particular,
B is not diagonalizable.

(c) First ﬁnd DðtÞ ¼ t2  8t þ 16 ¼ ðt  4Þ2 . Thus, l ¼ 4 is the only eigenvalue of C. Subtract l ¼ 4 down

The homogeneous system has only one independent solution; for example, x ¼ 1, y ¼ 1. Thus,
v ¼ ð1; 1Þ is an eigenvector of C. Furthermore, as there are no other eigenvalues, the singleton set
S ¼ fvg ¼ fð1; 1Þg is a maximal set of linearly independent eigenvectors of C. Furthermore, because S
is not a basis of R2 , C is not diagonalizable.

9.12. Suppose the matrix B in Problem 9.11 represents a linear operator on complex space C2 . Show
that, in this case, B is diagonalizable by ﬁnding a basis S of C2 consisting of eigenvectors of B.
The characteristic polynomial of B is still DðtÞ ¼ t2 þ 1. As a polynomial over C, DðtÞ does factor;
speciﬁcally, DðtÞ ¼ ðt  iÞðt þ iÞ. Thus, l ¼ i and l ¼ i are the eigenvalues of B.
(i) Subtract l ¼ i down the diagonal of B to obtain the homogeneous system

2x þ ð1  iÞy ¼ 0

ð1  iÞx  y ¼ 0

The system has only one independent solution; for example, x ¼ 1, y ¼ 1  i. Thus, v 1 ¼ ð1; 1  iÞ is
an eigenvector that spans the eigenspace of l ¼ i.
(ii) Subtract l ¼ i (or add i) down the diagonal of B to obtain the homogeneous system
ð1 þ iÞx 

2x þ ð1 þ iÞy ¼ 0

ð1 þ iÞx  y ¼ 0

or

The system has only one independent solution; for example, x ¼ 1, y ¼ 1 þ i. Thus, v 2 ¼ ð1; 1 þ iÞ is
an eigenvector that spans the eigenspace of l ¼ i.
As a complex matrix, B is diagonalizable. Speciﬁcally, S ¼ fv 1 ; v 2 g ¼ fð1; 1  iÞ; ð1; 1 þ iÞg is a basis of
C2 consisting of eigenvectors of B. Using this basis S, B is represented by the diagonal matrix
D ¼ diagði; iÞ.

is an eigenvector of L belonging to the eigenvalue l1 ¼ 1.
The vector v 2 ¼ ð1; kÞ is perpendicular to the line y ¼ kx, and hence, L reﬂects v 2 into its
negative; that is, Lðv 2 Þ ¼ v 2 . Thus, v 2 is an eigenvector of L belonging to the eigenvalue l2 ¼ 1.

Thus, S ¼ fu; v; wg ¼ fð1; 1; 0Þ; ð1; 0; 1Þ; ð1; 2; 1Þg is a maximal set of linearly independent
eigenvectors of A.

Remark: The vectors u and v were chosen so that they were independent solutions of the system
x þ y  z ¼ 0. On the other hand, w is automatically independent of u and v because w belongs to a
different eigenvalue of A. Thus, the three vectors are linearly independent.

B22 ¼ 0;

B33 ¼ 8;

so

Bii ¼ 12

Therefore, DðtÞ ¼ t3  12t þ 16 ¼ ðt  2Þ2 ðt þ 4Þ. Thus, l1 ¼ 2 and l2 ¼ 4 are the eigenvalues of B.
(b) Find a basis for the eigenspace of each eigenvalue of B.

The system has only one independent solution; for example, x ¼ 1, y ¼ 1, z ¼ 0. Thus,
u ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ forms a basis for the eigenspace of l1 ¼ 2.
Subtract l2 ¼ 4 (or add 4) down the diagonal of B to obtain
2
3
7x  y þ z ¼ 0

x yþ z¼0
corresponding to
7x  y þ z ¼ 0
or
M ¼ 4 7 1 1 5;
6y  6z ¼ 0
6x  6y þ 6z ¼ 0
6 6 6
The system has only one independent solution; for example, x ¼ 0, y ¼ 1, z ¼ 1. Thus,
v ¼ ð0; 1; 1Þ forms a basis for the eigenspace of l2 ¼ 4.

Thus S ¼ fu; vg is a maximal set of linearly independent eigenvectors of B.
(c) Because B has at most two linearly independent eigenvectors, B is not similar to a diagonal matrix; that
is, B is not diagonalizable.

9.16. Find the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalue l1 ¼ 2 of the matrix B in
Problem 9.15.
The algebraic multiplicity of l1 ¼ 2 is 2, because t  2 appears with exponent 2 in DðtÞ. However, the
geometric multiplicity of l1 ¼ 2 is 1, because dim El1 ¼ 1 (where El1 is the eigenspace of l1 ).

9.17. Let T: R3 ! R3 be deﬁned by T ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ð2x þ y  2z; 2x þ 3y  4z; x þ y  zÞ. Find all
eigenvalues of T , and ﬁnd a basis of each eigenspace. Is T diagonalizable? If so, ﬁnd the basis S of
R3 that diagonalizes T ; and ﬁnd its diagonal representation D.
First ﬁnd the matrix A that represents T relative to the usual basis of R3 by writing down the coefﬁcients
of x; y; z as rows, and then ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial of A (and T ). We have
2

A ¼ ½T  ¼ 4 2 3

and

trðAÞ ¼ 4; jAj ¼ 2
A11 ¼ 1; P

Aii ¼ 5
i

Therefore, DðtÞ ¼ t3  4t2 þ 5t  2 ¼ ðt  1Þ2 ðt  2Þ, and so l ¼ 1 and l ¼ 2 are the eigenvalues of A (and
T ). We next ﬁnd linearly independent eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of A.

1 1 2
M ¼ 4 2 2 4 5;
corresponding to
x þ y  2z ¼ 0
1 1 2
Here y and z are free variables, and so there are two linearly independent eigenvectors belonging
to l ¼ 1. For example, u ¼ ð1; 1; 0Þ and v ¼ ð2; 0; 1Þ are two such eigenvectors.
(ii) Subtract l ¼ 2 down the diagonal of A to obtain

or
y  2z ¼ 0
x þ y  3z ¼ 0
1 1 3
Only z is a free variable. Here w ¼ ð1; 2; 1Þ is a solution.

Thus, T is diagonalizable, because it has three independent eigenvectors. Speciﬁcally, choosing
S ¼ fu; v; wg ¼ fð1; 1; 0Þ;

ð2; 0; 1Þ;

ð1; 2; 1Þg

as a basis, T is represented by the diagonal matrix D ¼ diagð1; 1; 2Þ.

9.18. Prove the following for a linear operator (matrix) T :
(a) The scalar 0 is an eigenvalue of T if and only if T is singular.
(b) If l is an eigenvalue of T , where T is invertible, then l1 is an eigenvalue of T 1 .
(a) We have that 0 is an eigenvalue of T if and only if there is a vector v 6¼ 0 such that T ðvÞ ¼ 0v—that is, if
and only if T is singular.
(b) Because T is invertible, it is nonsingular; hence, by (a), l 6¼ 0. By deﬁnition of an eigenvalue, there
exists v 6¼ 0 such that T ðvÞ ¼ lv. Applying T 1 to both sides, we obtain
v ¼ T 1 ðlvÞ ¼ lT 1 ðvÞ;

T 1 ðvÞ ¼ l1 v

and so

Therefore, l1 is an eigenvalue of T 1 .

9.19. Let l be an eigenvalue of a linear operator T : V ! V , and let El consists of all the eigenvectors
belonging to l (called the eigenspace of l). Prove that El is a subspace of V . That is, prove
(a) If u 2 El , then ku 2 El for any scalar k. (b) If u; v; 2 El , then u þ v 2 El .
(a) Because u 2 El , we have T ðuÞ ¼ lu. Then T ðkuÞ ¼ kT ðuÞ ¼ kðluÞ ¼ lðkuÞ; and so ku 2 El :
(We view the zero vector 0 2 V as an ‘‘eigenvector’’ of l in order for El to be a subspace of V .)
(b) As u; v 2 El , we have T ðuÞ ¼ lu and T ðvÞ ¼ lv. Then
T ðu þ vÞ ¼ T ðuÞ þ T ðvÞ ¼ lu þ lv ¼ lðu þ vÞ; and so u þ v 2 El

9.20. Prove Theorem 9.6: The following are equivalent: (i) The scalar l is an eigenvalue of A.
(ii) The matrix lI  A is singular.
(iii) The scalar l is a root of the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of A.
The scalar l is an eigenvalue of A if and only if there exists a nonzero vector v such that
Av ¼ lv

or

ðlIÞv  Av ¼ 0

or

ðlI  AÞv ¼ 0

or lI  A is singular. In such a case, l is a root of DðtÞ ¼ jtI  Aj. Also, v is in the eigenspace El of l if and
only if the above relations hold. Hence, v is a solution of ðlI  AÞX ¼ 0.

9.21. Prove Theorem 9.80 : Suppose v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are nonzero eigenvectors of T belonging to distinct
eigenvalues l1 ; l2 ; . . . ; ln . Then v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n are linearly independent.

315

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Suppose the theorem is not true. Let v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v s be a minimal set of vectors for which the theorem is
not true. We have s > 1, because v 1 6¼ 0. Also, by the minimality condition, v 2 ; . . . ; v s are linearly
independent. Thus, v 1 is a linear combination of v 2 ; . . . ; v s , say,
v 1 ¼ a2 v 2 þ a3 v 3 þ    þ as v s

ð1Þ

(where some ak 6¼ 0Þ. Applying T to (1) and using the linearity of T yields
T ðv 1 Þ ¼ T ða2 v 2 þ a3 v 3 þ    þ as v s Þ ¼ a2 T ðv 2 Þ þ a3 T ðv 3 Þ þ    þ as T ðv s Þ

Because v j is an eigenvector of T belonging to lj , we have T ðv j Þ ¼ lj v j . Substituting in (2) yields
l1 v 1 ¼ a2 l2 v 2 þ a3 l3 v 3 þ    þ as ls v s

ð3Þ

l1 v 1 ¼ a2 l1 v 2 þ a3 l1 v 3 þ    þ as l1 v s

ð4Þ

Multiplying (1) by l1 yields

Setting the right-hand sides of (3) and (4) equal to each other, or subtracting (3) from (4) yields
a2 ðl1  l2 Þv 2 þ a3 ðl1  l3 Þv 3 þ    þ as ðl1  ls Þv s ¼ 0

ð5Þ

Because v 2 ; v 3 ; . . . ; v s are linearly independent, the coefﬁcients in (5) must all be zero. That is,
a2 ðl1  l2 Þ ¼ 0;

a3 ðl1  l3 Þ ¼ 0;

...;

as ðl1  ls Þ ¼ 0

However, the li are distinct. Hence l1  lj 6¼ 0 for j > 1. Hence, a2 ¼ 0, a3 ¼ 0; . . . ; as ¼ 0. This
contradicts the fact that some ak 6¼ 0. The theorem is proved.

9.22. Prove Theorem 9.9. Suppose DðtÞ ¼ ðt  a1 Þðt  a2 Þ . . . ðt  an Þ is the characteristic polynomial
of an n-square matrix A, and suppose the n roots ai are distinct. Then A is similar to the diagonal
matrix D ¼ diagða1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an Þ.
Let v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n be (nonzero) eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues ai . Then the n eigenvectors
v i are linearly independent (Theorem 9.8), and hence form a basis of K n . Accordingly, A is diagonalizable
(i.e., A is similar to a diagonal matrix D), and the diagonal elements of D are the eigenvalues ai .

9.23. Prove Theorem 9.100 : The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue l of T does not exceed its
algebraic multiplicity.
Suppose the geometric multiplicity of l is r. Then its eigenspace El contains r linearly independent
eigenvectors v 1 ; . . . ; v r . Extend the set fv i g to a basis of V , say, fv i ; . . . ; v r ; w1 ; . . . ; ws g. We have
T ðv 1 Þ ¼ lv 1 ;

Because M is block diagonal, the characteristic polynomial ðt  lÞr of the block lIr must divide the

B11 ¼ 0;

B22 ¼ 60;

B33 ¼ 75;

so

Hence, DðtÞ ¼ t3  6t2  135t  400. If DðtÞ has an integer root it must divide 400. Testing t ¼ 5, by

5

That is, 4x  2y þ z ¼ 0. The system has two independent solutions. One solution is v 1 ¼ ð0; 1; 2Þ. We

This system yields a nonzero solution v 3 ¼ ð4; 2; 1Þ. (As expected from Theorem 9.13, the

DðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  1Þ2 . Find the minimal polynomial mðtÞ of each matrix.
The minimal polynomial mðtÞ must divide DðtÞ. Also, each factor of DðtÞ (i.e., t  2 and t  1) must
also be a factor of mðtÞ. Thus, mðtÞ must be exactly one of the following:
f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  1Þ

or

gðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  1Þ2

(a) By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, gðAÞ ¼ DðAÞ ¼ 0, so we need only test f ðtÞ. We have

Thus, mðtÞ ¼ f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  1Þ ¼ t2  3t þ 2 is the minimal polynomial of A.
(b) Again gðBÞ ¼ DðBÞ ¼ 0, so we need only test f ðtÞ. We get

Thus, mðtÞ 6¼ f ðtÞ. Accordingly, mðtÞ ¼ gðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þðt  1Þ2 is the minimal polynomial of B. [We
emphasize that we do not need to compute gðBÞ; we know gðBÞ ¼ 0 from the Cayley–Hamilton theorem.]

(a) The characteristic polynomial of A is DðtÞ ¼ t2  12t þ 32 ¼ ðt  4Þðt  8Þ. Because DðtÞ has distinct
factors, the minimal polynomial mðtÞ ¼ DðtÞ ¼ t2  12t þ 32.
(b) Because B is triangular, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements 1; 2; 3; and so its characteristic
polynomial is DðtÞ ¼ ðt  1Þðt  2Þðt  3Þ. Because DðtÞ has distinct factors, mðtÞ ¼ DðtÞ.
(c) The characteristic polynomial of C is DðtÞ ¼ t2  6t þ 9 ¼ ðt  3Þ2 . Hence the minimal polynomial of C
is f ðtÞ ¼ t  3 or gðtÞ ¼ ðt  3Þ2 . However, f ðCÞ 6¼ 0; that is, C  3I 6¼ 0. Hence,
mðtÞ ¼ gðtÞ ¼ DðtÞ ¼ ðt  3Þ2 :

Fður Þ ¼ ar1 u1 þ ar2 u2 þ    þ ar;r1 ur1

319

CHAPTER 9 Diagonalization: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Hence, F 2 ður Þ ¼ FðFður ÞÞ is a linear combination of vectors preceding ur1 , and so on. Hence,
F r ður Þ ¼ 0 for each r. Thus, for each r, F n ður Þ ¼ F nr ð0Þ ¼ 0, and so F n ¼ 0, as claimed.
(b) We have Gðu1 Þ ¼ 0 and, for each k > 1, Gðuk Þ ¼ auk1 . Hence, Gr ðuk Þ ¼ ar ukr for r < k. Because a ¼

an1 ¼

9.30. Let B be the matrix in Example 9.12(a) that has 1’s on the diagonal, a’s on the superdiagonal,
where a 6¼ 0, and 0’s elsewhere. Show that f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  lÞn is both the characteristic polynomial
DðtÞ and the minimum polynomial mðtÞ of A.
Because A is triangular with l’s on the diagonal, DðtÞ ¼ f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  lÞn is its characteristic polynomial.
Thus, mðtÞ is a power of t  l. By Problem 9.29, ðA  lIÞr1 6¼ 0. Hence, mðtÞ ¼ DðtÞ ¼ ðt  lÞn .

polynomial that has A as a zero. In particular (by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem), mðtÞ divides the
characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of A.
Suppose f ðtÞ is a polynomial for which f ðAÞ ¼ 0. By the division algorithm, there exist polynomials
qðtÞ and rðtÞ for which f ðtÞ ¼ mðtÞqðtÞ þ rðtÞ and rðtÞ ¼ 0 or deg rðtÞ < deg mðtÞ. Substituting t ¼ A in this
equation, and using that f ðAÞ ¼ 0 and mðAÞ ¼ 0, we obtain rðAÞ ¼ 0. If rðtÞ 6¼ 0, then rðtÞ is a polynomial
of degree less than mðtÞ that has A as a zero. This contradicts the deﬁnition of the minimal polynomial. Thus,
rðtÞ ¼ 0, and so f ðtÞ ¼ mðtÞqðtÞ; that is, mðtÞ divides f ðtÞ.

Taking the determinant of both sides gives jtI  AjjBðtÞj ¼ jmðtÞIj ¼ ½mðtÞn . Because jBðtÞj is a polynomial, jtI  Aj divides ½mðtÞn ; that is, the characteristic polynomial of A divides ½mðtÞn .

9.35. Prove Theorem 9.16: The characteristic polynomial DðtÞ and the minimal polynomial mðtÞ of A
have the same irreducible factors.
Suppose f ðtÞ is an irreducible polynomial. If f ðtÞ divides mðtÞ, then f ðtÞ also divides DðtÞ [because mðtÞ
divides DðtÞ. On the other hand, if f ðtÞ divides DðtÞ, then by Problem 9.34, f ðtÞ also divides ½mðtÞn . But f ðtÞ
is irreducible; hence, f ðtÞ also divides mðtÞ. Thus, mðtÞ and DðtÞ have the same irreducible factors.

9.36. Prove Theorem 9.19: The minimal polynomial mðtÞ of a block diagonal matrix M with diagonal
blocks Ai is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the minimal polynomials of the

We

mðBÞ
mðBÞ ¼ 0. Because gðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of A, gðtÞ divides mðtÞ. Similarly, hðtÞ divides mðtÞ. Thus
mðtÞ is a multiple of gðtÞ and hðtÞ.

mðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of M; hence, mðtÞ divides f ðtÞ. Thus, mðtÞ is the LCM of gðtÞ and hðtÞ.

Prove the following:
(a) A is nonsingular if and only if the constant term a0 6¼ 0.

Canonical Forms
10.1

Introduction

Let T be a linear operator on a vector space of ﬁnite dimension. As seen in Chapter 6, T may not have a
diagonal matrix representation. However, it is still possible to ‘‘simplify’’ the matrix representation of T
in a number of ways. This is the main topic of this chapter. In particular, we obtain the primary
decomposition theorem, and the triangular, Jordan, and rational canonical forms.
We comment that the triangular and Jordan canonical forms exist for T if and only if the characteristic
polynomial DðtÞ of T has all its roots in the base ﬁeld K. This is always true if K is the complex ﬁeld C
but may not be true if K is the real ﬁeld R.
We also introduce the idea of a quotient space. This is a very powerful tool, and it will be used in the
proof of the existence of the triangular and rational canonical forms.

10.2

Triangular Form

Let T be a linear operator on an n-dimensional vector space V. Suppose T can be represented by the
triangular matrix
2
3
a11 a12 . . . a1n
6
a22 . . . a2n 7
7
A¼6
4
... ... 5
ann
Then the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T is a product of linear factors; that is,
DðtÞ ¼ detðtI  AÞ ¼ ðt  a11 Þðt  a22 Þ    ðt  ann Þ
The converse is also true and is an important theorem (proved in Problem 10.28).
THEOREM 10.1:

Let T :V ! V be a linear operator whose characteristic polynomial factors into
linear polynomials. Then there exists a basis of V in which T is represented by a
triangular matrix.

THEOREM 10.1:

(Alternative Form) Let A be a square matrix whose characteristic polynomial
factors into linear polynomials. Then A is similar to a triangular matrix—that is,
there exists an invertible matrix P such that P1 AP is triangular.

We say that an operator T can be brought into triangular form if it can be represented by a triangular
matrix. Note that in this case, the eigenvalues of T are precisely those entries appearing on the main
diagonal. We give an application of this remark.

Invariance

Let T :V ! V be linear. A subspace W of V is said to be invariant under T or T-invariant if T maps W
into itself—that is, if v 2 W implies T ðvÞ 2 W. In this case, T restricted to W deﬁnes a linear operator on
W; that is, T induces a linear operator T^:W ! W deﬁned by T^ðwÞ ¼ T ðwÞ for every w 2 W.
EXAMPLE 10.2

(a) Let T : R3 ! R3 be the following linear operator, which rotates each vector v about the z-axis by an angle y
(shown in Fig. 10-1):

T ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx cos y  y sin y; x sin y þ y cos y; zÞ

Observe that each vector w ¼ ða; b; 0Þ in the xy-plane W remains in W under the mapping T ; hence, W is
T -invariant. Observe also that the z-axis U is invariant under T. Furthermore, the restriction of T to W rotates
each vector about the origin O, and the restriction of T to U is the identity mapping of U.
(b) Nonzero eigenvectors of a linear operator T :V ! V may be characterized as generators of T -invariant
one-dimensional subspaces. Suppose T ðvÞ ¼ lv, v 6¼ 0. Then W ¼ fkv; k 2 Kg, the one-dimensional
subspace generated by v, is invariant under T because

T ðkvÞ ¼ kT ðvÞ ¼ kðlvÞ ¼ klv 2 W
Conversely, suppose dim U ¼ 1 and u 6¼ 0 spans U, and U is invariant under T. Then T ðuÞ 2 U and so T ðuÞ is a
multiple of u—that is, T ðuÞ ¼ mu. Hence, u is an eigenvector of T.

The next theorem (proved in Problem 10.3) gives us an important class of invariant subspaces.
THEOREM 10.2:

Let T :V ! V be any linear operator, and let f ðtÞ be any polynomial. Then the
kernel of f ðT Þ is invariant under T.

The notion of invariance is related to matrix representations (Problem 10.5) as follows.
THEOREM 10.3:

Suppose W
 is an invariant subspace of T :V ! V. Then T has a block matrix repreA B

Invariant Direct-Sum Decompositions

V ¼ W1

...

Wr

if every vector v 2 V can be written uniquely in the form
v ¼ w1 þ w2 þ . . . þ wr ;

with

wi 2 W i

The following theorem (proved in Problem 10.7) holds.
THEOREM 10.4:

Suppose W1 ; W2 ; . . . ; Wr are subspaces of V, and suppose
B1 ¼ fw11 ; w12 ; . . . ; w1n1 g;

...;

Br ¼ fwr1 ; wr2 ; . . . ; wrnr g

are bases of W1 ; W2 ; . . . ; Wr , respectively. Then V is the direct sum of the Wi if and
only if the union B ¼ B1 [ . . . [ Br is a basis of V.
Now suppose T :V ! V is linear and V is the direct sum of (nonzero) T -invariant subspaces
W1 ; W2 ; . . . ; Wr ; that is,
V ¼ W1

...

Wr

T ðWi Þ  Wi ;

and

i ¼ 1; . . . ; r

Let Ti denote the restriction of T to Wi . Then T is said to be decomposable into the operators Ti or T is
said to be the direct sum of the Ti ; written T ¼ T1 . . . Tr : Also, the subspaces W1 ; . . . ; Wr are said to
reduce T or to form a T-invariant direct-sum decomposition of V.
Consider the special case where two subspaces U and W reduce an operator T :V ! V ; say dim U ¼ 2
and dim W ¼ 3, and suppose fu1 ; u2 g and fw1 ; w2 ; w3 g are bases of U and W, respectively. If T1 and T2
denote the restrictions of T to U and W, respectively, then
T1 ðu1 Þ ¼ a11 u1 þ a12 u2
T1 ðu2 Þ ¼ a21 u1 þ a22 u2

T2 ðw1 Þ ¼ b11 w1 þ b12 w2 þ b13 w3
T2 ðw2 Þ ¼ b21 w1 þ b22 w2 þ b23 w3
T2 ðw3 Þ ¼ b31 w1 þ b32 w2 þ b33 w3

Accordingly, the following matrices A; B; M are the matrix representations of T1 , T2 , T, respectively,

B ¼ b12 b22 b32 ;

The block diagonal matrix M results from the fact that fu1 ; u2 ; w1 ; w2 ; w3 g is a basis of V (Theorem 10.4),
and that Tðui Þ ¼ T1 ðui Þ and T ðwj Þ ¼ T2 ðwj Þ.
A generalization of the above argument gives us the following theorem.

THEOREM 10.5:

Suppose T :V ! V is linear and suppose V is the direct sum of T -invariant
subspaces, say, W1 ; . . . ; Wr . If Ai is a matrix representation of the restriction of
T to Wi , then T can be represented by the block diagonal matrix:
M ¼ diagðA1 ; A2 ; . . . ; Ar Þ

10.5

Primary Decomposition

The following theorem shows that any operator T :V ! V is decomposable into operators whose
minimum polynomials are powers of irreducible polynomials. This is the ﬁrst step in obtaining a
canonical form for T.

328

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms

THEOREM 10.6:

(Primary Decomposition Theorem) Let T :V ! V be a linear operator with
minimal polynomial
mðtÞ ¼ f1 ðtÞn1 f2 ðtÞn2    fr ðtÞnr
where the fi ðtÞ are distinct monic irreducible polynomials. Then V is the direct sum
of T -invariant subspaces W1 ; . . . ; Wr , where Wi is the kernel of fi ðTÞni . Moreover,
fi ðtÞni is the minimal polynomial of the restriction of T to Wi .

The above polynomials fi ðtÞni are relatively prime. Therefore, the above fundamental theorem
follows (Problem 10.11) from the next two theorems (proved in Problems 10.9 and 10.10, respectively).
THEOREM 10.7:

Suppose T :V ! V is linear, and suppose f ðtÞ ¼ gðtÞhðtÞ are polynomials such that
f ðT Þ ¼ 0 and gðtÞ and hðtÞ are relatively prime. Then V is the direct sum of the
T -invariant subspace U and W, where U ¼ Ker gðT Þ and W ¼ Ker hðT Þ.

THEOREM 10.8:

In Theorem 10.7, if f ðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of T [and gðtÞ and hðtÞ are
monic], then gðtÞ and hðtÞ are the minimal polynomials of the restrictions of T to U
and W, respectively.

We will also use the primary decomposition theorem to prove the following useful characterization of
diagonalizable operators (see Problem 10.12 for the proof).
THEOREM 10.9:

A linear operator T :V ! V is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial
mðtÞ is a product of distinct linear polynomials.

THEOREM 10.9:

(Alternative Form) A matrix A is similar to a diagonal matrix if and only if its
minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear polynomials.

EXAMPLE 10.3 Suppose A 6¼ I is a square matrix for which A3 ¼ I. Determine whether or not A is similar to a

diagonal matrix if A is a matrix over: (i) the real ﬁeld R, (ii) the complex ﬁeld C.
Because A3 ¼ I, A is a zero of the polynomial f ðtÞ ¼ t3  1 ¼ ðt  1Þðt2 þ t þ 1Þ: The minimal polynomial mðtÞ
of A cannot be t  1, because A 6¼ I. Hence,

mðtÞ ¼ t2 þ t þ 1

or

mðtÞ ¼ t3  1

Because neither polynomial is a product of linear polynomials over R, A is not diagonalizable over R. On the
other hand, each of the polynomials is a product of distinct linear polynomials over C. Hence, A is diagonalizable
over C.

10.6

Nilpotent Operators

A linear operator T :V ! V is termed nilpotent if T n ¼ 0 for some positive integer n; we call k the index
of nilpotency of T if T k ¼ 0 but T k1 6¼ 0: Analogously, a square matrix A is termed nilpotent if An ¼ 0
for some positive integer n, and of index k if Ak ¼ 0 but Ak1 6¼ 0. Clearly the minimum polynomial of a
nilpotent operator (matrix) of index k is mðtÞ ¼ tk ; hence, 0 is its only eigenvalue.

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms

The ﬁrst matrix N , called a Jordan nilpotent block, consists of 1’s above the diagonal (called the superdiagonal), and 0’s elsewhere. It is a nilpotent matrix of index r. (The matrix N of order 1 is just the 1 1 zero
matrix [0].)
The second matrix J ðlÞ, called a Jordan block belonging to the eigenvalue l, consists of l’s on the diagonal, 1’s
on the superdiagonal, and 0’s elsewhere. Observe that

J ðlÞ ¼ lI þ N
In fact, we will prove that any linear operator T can be decomposed into operators, each of which is the sum of a
scalar operator and a nilpotent operator.

The following (proved in Problem 10.16) is a fundamental result on nilpotent operators.
THEOREM 10.10:

Let T :V ! V be a nilpotent operator of index k. Then T has a block diagonal
matrix representation in which each diagonal entry is a Jordan nilpotent block N .
There is at least one N of order k, and all other N are of orders  k. The number of
N of each possible order is uniquely determined by T. The total number of N of all
orders is equal to the nullity of T.

The proof of Theorem 10.10 shows that the number of N of order i is equal to 2mi  miþ1  mi1 ,
where mi is the nullity of T i .

10.7

Jordan Canonical Form

An operator T can be put into Jordan canonical form if its characteristic and minimal polynomials factor
into linear polynomials. This is always true if K is the complex ﬁeld C. In any case, we can always extend
the base ﬁeld K to a ﬁeld in which the characteristic and minimal polynomials do factor into linear
factors; thus, in a broad sense, every operator has a Jordan canonical form. Analogously, every matrix is
similar to a matrix in Jordan canonical form.
The following theorem (proved in Problem 10.18) describes the Jordan canonical form J of a linear
operator T.
THEOREM 10.11:

Let T :V ! V be a linear operator whose characteristic and minimal polynomials
are, respectively,
DðtÞ ¼ ðt  l1 Þn1    ðt  lr Þnr

and

mðtÞ ¼ ðt  l1 Þm1    ðt  lr Þmr

where the li are distinct scalars. Then T has a block diagonal matrix representation J in which each diagonal entry is a Jordan block Jij ¼ J ðli Þ. For each lij , the
corresponding Jij have the following properties:
(i) There is at least one Jij of order mi ; all other Jij are of order  mi .
(ii) The sum of the orders of the Jij is ni .
(iii) The number of Jij equals the geometric multiplicity of li .
(iv) The number of Jij of each possible order is uniquely determined by T.
EXAMPLE 10.5 Suppose the characteristic and minimal polynomials of an operator T are, respec-

tively,
DðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ4 ðt  5Þ3

and

mðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ2 ðt  5Þ3

Cyclic Subspaces

Let T be a linear operator on a vector space V of ﬁnite dimension over K. Suppose v 2 V and v 6¼ 0. The
set of all vectors of the form f ðT ÞðvÞ, where f ðtÞ ranges over all polynomials over K, is a T -invariant
subspace of V called the T-cyclic subspace of V generated by v; we denote it by Zðv; T Þ and denote the
restriction of T to Zðv; T Þ by Tv : By Problem 10.56, we could equivalently deﬁne Zðv; T Þ as the
intersection of all T -invariant subspaces of V containing v.
Now consider the sequence
v; T ðvÞ; T 2 ðvÞ; T 3 ðvÞ; . . .
of powers of T acting on v. Let k be the least integer such that T k ðvÞ is a linear combination of those
vectors that precede it in the sequence, say,
T k ðvÞ ¼ ak1 T k1 ðvÞ      a1 T ðvÞ  a0 v
Then
mv ðtÞ ¼ tk þ ak1 tk1 þ    þ a1 t þ a0
is the unique monic polynomial of lowest degree for which mv ðT ÞðvÞ ¼ 0. We call mv ðtÞ the
T-annihilator of v and Zðv; T Þ.
The following theorem (proved in Problem 10.29) holds.
THEOREM 10.12:

Let Zðv; T Þ, Tv , mv ðtÞ be deﬁned as above. Then
(i) The set fv; T ðvÞ; . . . ; T k1 ðvÞg is a basis of Zðv; T Þ; hence, dim Zðv; T Þ ¼ k.

Rational Canonical Form

In this section, we present the rational canonical form for a linear operator T :V ! V. We emphasize that

that this is not the case for the Jordan canonical form.)

Any other decomposition of V into T -cyclic subspaces has the same number of
components and the same set of T -annihilators.
We emphasize that the above lemma (proved in Problem 10.31) does not say that the vectors v i or
other T -cyclic subspaces Zðv i ; T Þ are uniquely determined by T , but it does say that the set of
T -annihilators is uniquely determined by T. Thus, T has a unique block diagonal matrix representation:
M ¼ diagðC1 ; C2 ; . . . ; Cr Þ
where the Ci are companion matrices. In fact, the Ci are the companion matrices of the polynomials f ðtÞni .
Using the Primary Decomposition Theorem and Lemma 10.13, we obtain the following result.
THEOREM 10.14:

Let T :V ! V be a linear operator with minimal polynomial
mðtÞ ¼ f1 ðtÞm1 f2 ðtÞm2    fs ðtÞms
where the fi ðtÞ are distinct monic irreducible polynomials. Then T has a unique
block diagonal matrix representation:
M ¼ diagðC11 ; C12 ; . . . ; C1r1 ; . . . ; Cs1 ; Cs2 ; . . . ; Csrs Þ
where the Cij are companion matrices. In particular, the Cij are the companion
matrices of the polynomials fi ðtÞnij , where
m1 ¼ n11  n12      n1r1 ;

...;

ms ¼ ns1  ns2      nsrs

The above matrix representation of T is called its rational canonical form. The polynomials fi ðtÞnij
are called the elementary divisors of T.
EXAMPLE 10.6 Let V be a vector space of dimension 8 over the rational ﬁeld Q, and let T be a linear operator on
V whose minimal polynomial is

mðtÞ ¼ f1 ðtÞf2 ðtÞ2 ¼ ðt4  4t3 þ 6t2  4t  7Þðt  3Þ2
Thus, because dim V ¼ 8; the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ ¼ f1 ðtÞ f2 ðtÞ4 : Also, the rational canonical form M of T
must have one block the companion matrix of f1 ðtÞ and one block the companion matrix of f2 ðtÞ2 . There are two
possibilities:

Quotient Spaces

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K and let W be a subspace of V. If v is any vector in V, we write
v þ W for the set of sums v þ w with w 2 W ; that is,
v þ W ¼ fv þ w : w 2 W g

332

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms

These sets are called the cosets of W in V. We show (Problem 10.22) that these cosets partition V into
mutually disjoint subsets.
EXAMPLE 10.7 Let W be the subspace of R2 deﬁned by

W ¼ fða; bÞ : a ¼ bg;
that is, W is the line given by the equation x  y ¼ 0. We can view
v þ W as a translation of the line obtained by adding the vector v
to each point in W. As shown in Fig. 10-2, the coset v þ W is also
a line, and it is parallel to W. Thus, the cosets of W in R2 are
precisely all the lines parallel to W.

In the following theorem, we use the cosets of a subspace
W of a vector space V to deﬁne a new vector space; it is
called the quotient space of V by W and is denoted by V =W.
THEOREM 10.15:

Figure 10-2

Let W be a subspace of a vector space over a ﬁeld K. Then the cosets of W in V
form a vector space over K with the following operations of addition and scalar
multiplication:
ðiÞ ðu þ wÞ þ ðv þ W Þ ¼ ðu þ vÞ þ W ; ðiiÞ kðu þ W Þ ¼ ku þ W ; where k 2 K

We note that, in the proof of Theorem 10.15 (Problem 10.24), it is ﬁrst necessary to show that the
operations are well deﬁned; that is, whenever u þ W ¼ u0 þ W and v þ W ¼ v 0 þ W, then
ðiÞ ðu þ vÞ þ W ¼ ðu0 þ v 0 Þ þ W

and

ðiiÞ ku þ W ¼ ku0 þ W

for any k 2 K

In the case of an invariant subspace, we have the following useful result (proved in Problem 10.27).
THEOREM 10.16:

Suppose W is a subspace invariant under a linear operator T :V ! V. Then T
 þ W Þ ¼ T ðvÞ þ W. Moreover,
induces a linear operator T on V =W deﬁned by Tðv

if T is a zero of any polynomial, then so is T . Thus, the minimal polynomial of T
divides the minimal polynomial of T.

Invariant Subspaces
10.1. Suppose T :V ! V is linear. Show that each of the following is invariant under T :
(a) f0g, (b) V, (c)

kernel of T, (d) image of T.

(a) We have T ð0Þ ¼ 0 2 f0g; hence, f0g is invariant under T.
(b) For every v 2 V , T ðvÞ 2 V; hence, V is invariant under T.
(c) Let u 2 Ker T . Then T ðuÞ ¼ 0 2 Ker T because the kernel of T is a subspace of V. Thus, Ker T is
invariant under T.
(d) Because T ðvÞ 2 Im T for every v 2 V, it is certainly true when v 2 Im T . Hence, the image of T is
invariant under T.

10.2. Suppose fWi g is T
a collection of T -invariant subspaces of a vector space V. Show that the
intersection W ¼ i Wi is also T -invariant.
Suppose v 2 W ; then v 2 Wi for every i. Because Wi is T -invariant, T ðvÞ 2 Wi for every i. Thus,
T ðvÞ 2 W and so W is T -invariant.

By Problem 10.1, R2 and f0g are invariant under A. Now if A has any other invariant subspace, it must
be one-dimensional. However, the characteristic polynomial of A is
DðtÞ ¼ t2  trðAÞ t þ jAj ¼ t2 þ 1
Hence, A has no eigenvalues (in R) and so A has no eigenvectors. But the one-dimensional invariant
subspaces correspond to the eigenvectors; thus, R2 and f0g are the only subspaces invariant under A.

(a) For any polynomial f ðtÞ, f ðT^ÞðwÞ ¼ f ðT ÞðwÞ.
(b) The minimal polynomial of T^ divides the minimal polynomial of T.
(a) If f ðtÞ ¼ 0 or if f ðtÞ is a constant (i.e., of degree 1), then the result clearly holds.
Assume deg f ¼ n > 1 and that the result holds for polynomials of degree less than n. Suppose that

(b) Let mðtÞ denote the minimal polynomial of T. Then by (a), mðT^ÞðwÞ ¼ mðT ÞðwÞ ¼ 0ðwÞ ¼ 0 for
every w 2 W ; that is, T^ is a zero of the polynomial mðtÞ. Hence, the minimal polynomial of T^ divides
mðtÞ.

Invariant Direct-Sum Decompositions
10.7. Prove Theorem 10.4: Suppose W1 ; W2 ; . . . ; Wr are subspaces of V with respective bases
B1 ¼ fw11 ; w12 ; . . . ; w1n1 g;

...;

Br ¼ fwr1 ; wr2 ; . . . ; wrnr g
S
Then V is the direct sum of the Wi if and only if the union B ¼ i Bi is a basis of V.
Suppose B is a basis of V. Then, for any v 2 V,
v ¼ a11 w11 þ    þ a1n1 w1n1 þ    þ ar1 wr1 þ    þ arnr wrnr ¼ w1 þ w2 þ    þ wr
where wi ¼ ai1 wi1 þ    þ aini wini 2 Wi . We next show that such a sum is unique. Suppose
v ¼ w01 þ w02 þ    þ w0r ;

where

w0i 2 Wi

Because fwi1 ; . . . ; wini g is a basis of Wi , w0i ¼ bi1 wi1 þ    þ bini wini , and so
v ¼ b11 w11 þ    þ b1n1 w1n1 þ    þ br1 wr1 þ    þ brnr wrnr
Because B is a basis of V ; aij ¼ bij , for each i and each j. Hence, wi ¼ w0i , and so the sum for v is unique.
Accordingly, V is the direct sum of the Wi .
Conversely, suppose V is the direct sum of the Wi . Then for any v 2 V, v ¼ w1 þ    þ wr , where
wi 2 Wi . Because fwiji g is a basis of Wi , each wi is a linear combination of the wiji , and so v is a linear
combination of the elements of B. Thus, B spans V. We now show that B is linearly independent. Suppose
a11 w11 þ    þ a1n1 w1n1 þ    þ ar1 wr1 þ    þ arnr wrnr ¼ 0
Note that ai1 wi1 þ    þ aini wini 2 Wi . We also have that 0 ¼ 0 þ 0    0 2 Wi . Because such a sum for 0 is
unique,
ai1 wi1 þ    þ aini wini ¼ 0 for i ¼ 1; . . . ; r
The independence of the bases fwiji g implies that all the a’s are 0. Thus, B is linearly independent and is a
basis of V.

(a) mðtÞ is the least common multiple of m1 ðtÞ and m2 ðtÞ, where mðtÞ, m1 ðtÞ, m2 ðtÞ are the
minimum polynomials of T ; T1 ; T2 , respectively.
(b) DðtÞ ¼ D1 ðtÞD2 ðtÞ, where DðtÞ; D1 ðtÞ, D2 ðtÞ are the characteristic polynomials of T ; T1 ; T2 ,
respectively.
(a) By Problem 10.6, each of m1 ðtÞ and m2 ðtÞ divides mðtÞ. Now suppose f ðtÞ is a multiple of both m1 ðtÞ
and m2 ðtÞ, then f ðT1 ÞðU Þ ¼ 0 and f ðT2 ÞðW Þ ¼ 0. Let v 2 V , then v ¼ u þ w with u 2 U and w 2 W.
Now
f ðT Þv ¼ f ðT Þu þ f ðT Þw ¼ f ðT1 Þu þ f ðT2 Þw ¼ 0 þ 0 ¼ 0
That is, T is a zero of f ðtÞ. Hence, mðtÞ divides f ðtÞ, and so mðtÞ is the least common multiple of m1 ðtÞ
and m2 ðtÞ.

10.9. Prove Theorem 10.7: Suppose T :V ! V is linear, and suppose f ðtÞ ¼ gðtÞhðtÞ are polynomials
such that f ðT Þ ¼ 0 and gðtÞ and hðtÞ are relatively prime. Then V is the direct sum of the
T -invariant subspaces U and W where U ¼ Ker gðT Þ and W ¼ Ker hðT Þ.

335

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms

Note ﬁrst that U and W are T -invariant by Theorem 10.2. Now, because gðtÞ and hðtÞ are relatively
prime, there exist polynomials rðtÞ and sðtÞ such that
rðtÞgðtÞ þ sðtÞhðtÞ ¼ 1
Hence; for the operator T ;

rðT ÞgðT Þ þ sðT ÞhðT Þ ¼ I

Let v 2 V ; then; by ð*Þ;

v ¼ rðT ÞgðT Þv þ sðT ÞhðT Þv

ð*Þ

But the ﬁrst term in this sum belongs to W ¼ Ker hðT Þ, because
hðT ÞrðT ÞgðT Þv ¼ rðT ÞgðT ÞhðT Þv ¼ rðT Þf ðT Þv ¼ rðT Þ0v ¼ 0
Similarly, the second term belongs to U. Hence, V is the sum of U and W.
To prove that V ¼ U W, we must show that a sum v ¼ u þ w with u 2 U , w 2 W, is uniquely
determined by v. Applying the operator rðT ÞgðT Þ to v ¼ u þ w and using gðT Þu ¼ 0, we obtain
rðT ÞgðT Þv ¼ rðT ÞgðT Þu þ rðT ÞgðT Þw ¼ rðT ÞgðT Þw
Also, applying ð*Þ to w alone and using hðT Þw ¼ 0, we obtain
w ¼ rðT ÞgðT Þw þ sðT ÞhðT Þw ¼ rðT ÞgðT Þw
Both of the above formulas give us w ¼ rðT ÞgðT Þv, and so w is uniquely determined by v. Similarly u is
uniquely determined by v. Hence, V ¼ U W, as required.

10.10. Prove Theorem 10.8: In Theorem 10.7 (Problem 10.9), if f ðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of T
(and gðtÞ and hðtÞ are monic), then gðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of the restriction T1 of T to U
and hðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of the restriction T2 of T to W.
Let m1 ðtÞ and m2 ðtÞ be the minimal polynomials of T1 and T2 , respectively. Note that gðT1 Þ ¼ 0 and
hðT2 Þ ¼ 0 because U ¼ Ker gðT Þ and W ¼ Ker hðT Þ. Thus,
and
m2 ðtÞ divides hðtÞ
ð1Þ
m1 ðtÞ divides gðtÞ
By Problem 10.9, f ðtÞ is the least common multiple of m1 ðtÞ and m2 ðtÞ. But m1 ðtÞ and m2 ðtÞ are relatively
prime because gðtÞ and hðtÞ are relatively prime. Accordingly, f ðtÞ ¼ m1 ðtÞm2 ðtÞ. We also have that
f ðtÞ ¼ gðtÞhðtÞ. These two equations together with (1) and the fact that all the polynomials are monic imply
that gðtÞ ¼ m1 ðtÞ and hðtÞ ¼ m2 ðtÞ, as required.

10.11. Prove the Primary Decomposition Theorem 10.6: Let T :V ! V be a linear operator with
minimal polynomial
mðtÞ ¼ f1 ðtÞn1 f2 ðtÞn2 . . . fr ðtÞnr
where the fi ðtÞ are distinct monic irreducible polynomials. Then V is the direct sum of T invariant subspaces W1 ; . . . ; Wr where Wi is the kernel of fi ðT Þni . Moreover, fi ðtÞni is the minimal
polynomial of the restriction of T to Wi .
The proof is by induction on r. The case r ¼ 1 is trivial. Suppose that the theorem has been proved for
r  1. By Theorem 10.7, we can write V as the direct sum of T -invariant subspaces W1 and V1 , where W1 is
the kernel of f1 ðT Þn1 and where V1 is the kernel of f2 ðT Þn2    fr ðT Þnr . By Theorem 10.8, the minimal
polynomials of the restrictions of T to W1 and V1 are f1 ðtÞn1 and f2 ðtÞn2    fr ðtÞnr , respectively.
Denote the restriction of T to V1 by T^1 . By the inductive hypothesis, V1 is the direct sum of subspaces
W2 ; . . . ; Wr such that Wi is the kernel of fi ðT1 Þni and such that fi ðtÞni is the minimal polynomial for the
restriction of T^1 to Wi . But the kernel of fi ðT Þni , for i ¼ 2; . . . ; r is necessarily contained in V1 , because
fi ðtÞni divides f2 ðtÞn2    fr ðtÞnr . Thus, the kernel of fi ðT Þni is the same as the kernel of fi ðT1 Þni , which is Wi .
Also, the restriction of T to Wi is the same as the restriction of T^1 to Wi (for i ¼ 2; . . . ; r); hence, fi ðtÞni is
also the minimal polynomial for the restriction of T to Wi . Thus, V ¼ W1 W2    Wr is the desired
decomposition of T.

10.12. Prove Theorem 10.9: A linear operator T :V ! V has a diagonal matrix representation if and only
if its minimal polynomal mðtÞ is a product of distinct linear polynomials.

336

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms
Suppose mðtÞ is a product of distinct linear polynomials, say,
mðtÞ ¼ ðt  l1 Þðt  l2 Þ    ðt  lr Þ
where the li are distinct scalars. By the Primary Decomposition Theorem, V is the direct sum of subspaces
W1 ; . . . ; Wr , where Wi ¼ KerðT  li IÞ. Thus, if v 2 Wi , then ðT  li IÞðvÞ ¼ 0 or T ðvÞ ¼ li v. In other
words, every vector in Wi is an eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue li . By Theorem 10.4, the union of
bases for W1 ; . . . ; Wr is a basis of V. This basis consists of eigenvectors, and so T is diagonalizable.
Conversely, suppose T is diagonalizable (i.e., V has a basis consisting of eigenvectors of T ). Let
l1 ; . . . ; ls be the distinct eigenvalues of T. Then the operator
f ðT Þ ¼ ðT  l1 IÞðT  l2 IÞ    ðT  ls IÞ
maps each basis vector into 0. Thus, f ðT Þ ¼ 0, and hence, the minimal polynomial mðtÞ of T divides the
polynomial
f ðtÞ ¼ ðt  l1 Þðt  l2 Þ    ðt  ls IÞ
Accordingly, mðtÞ is a product of distinct linear polynomials.

(b) The subspace W generated by S is T -invariant.

Now applying T k2 to ð*Þ and using T k ðvÞ ¼ 0 and a ¼ 0, we ﬁind a1 T k1 ðvÞ ¼ 0; hence, a1 ¼ 0.
Next applying T k3 to ð*Þ and using T k ðvÞ ¼ 0 and a ¼ a1 ¼ 0, we obtain a2 T k1 ðvÞ ¼ 0; hence,
a2 ¼ 0. Continuing this process, we ﬁnd that all the a’s are 0; hence, S is independent.

Thus, W is T -invariant.
(c) By hypothesis, T k ðvÞ ¼ 0. Hence, for i ¼ 0; . . . ; k  1,
T^k ðT i ðvÞÞ ¼ T kþi ðvÞ ¼ 0
That is, applying T^k to each generator of W, we obtain 0; hence, T^k ¼ 0 and so T^ is nilpotent of index

10.14. Let T :V ! V be linear. Let U ¼ Ker T i and W ¼ Ker T iþ1 . Show that
(a) U  W,

(b) T ðW Þ  U .

(a) Suppose u 2 U ¼ Ker T i . Then T i ðuÞ ¼ 0 and so T iþ1 ðuÞ ¼ T ðT i ðuÞÞ ¼ T ð0Þ ¼ 0. Thus,
u 2 Ker T iþ1 ¼ W. But this is true for every u 2 U ; hence, U  W.
(b) Similarly, if w 2 W ¼ Ker T iþ1 , then T iþ1 ðwÞ ¼ 0: Thus, T iþ1 ðwÞ ¼ T i ðT ðwÞÞ ¼ T i ð0Þ ¼ 0 and so
T ðW Þ  U .

10.15. Let T :V be linear. Let X ¼ Ker T i2 , Y ¼ Ker T i1 , Z ¼ Ker T i . Therefore (Problem 10.14),

fu1 ; . . . ; ur ; v 1 ; . . . ; v s g;
fu1 ; . . . ; ur ; v 1 ; . . . ; v s ; w1 ; . . . ; wt g
are bases of X ; Y ; Z, respectively. Show that
S ¼ fu1 ; . . . ; ur ; Tðw1 Þ; . . . ; T ðwt Þg
is contained in Y and is linearly independent.
By Problem 10.14, T ðZÞ  Y , and hence S  Y . Now suppose S is linearly dependent. Then there
exists a relation
a1 u1 þ    þ ar ur þ b1 T ðw1 Þ þ    þ bt T ðwt Þ ¼ 0
where at least one coefﬁcient is not zero. Furthermore, because fui g is independent, at least one of the bk

b1 T ðw1 Þ þ    þ bt T ðwt Þ ¼ a1 u1      ar ur 2 X ¼ Ker T i2
Hence;
Thus;

T i2 ðb1 T ðw1 Þ þ    þ bt T ðwt ÞÞ ¼ 0
and so
b1 w1 þ    þ bt wt 2 Y ¼ Ker T i1
T i1 ðb1 w1 þ    þ bt wt Þ ¼ 0;

Because fui ; v j g generates Y, we obtain a relation among the ui , v j , wk where one of the coefﬁcients (i.e.,
one of the bk ) is not zero. This contradicts the fact that fui ; v j ; wk g is independent. Hence, S must also be

Suppose dim V ¼ n. Let W1 ¼ Ker T, W2 ¼ Ker T 2 ; . . . ; Wk ¼ Ker T k . Let us set mi ¼ dim Wi , for
i ¼ 1; . . . ; k. Because T is of index k, Wk ¼ V and Wk1 6¼ V and so mk1 < mk ¼ n. By Problem 10.14,
W1  W2      Wk ¼ V
Thus, by induction, we can choose a basis fu1 ; . . . ; un g of V such that fu1 ; . . . ; umi g is a basis of Wi .
We now choose a new basis for V with respect to which T has the desired form. It will be convenient
to label the members of this new basis by pairs of indices. We begin by setting
vð1; kÞ ¼ umk1 þ1 ;
vð2; kÞ ¼ umk1 þ2 ;
...;
vðmk  mk1 ; kÞ ¼ umk
and setting
vð1; k  1Þ ¼ T vð1; kÞ;

vð2; k  1Þ ¼ T vð2; kÞ;

...;

vðmk  mk1 ; k  1Þ ¼ T vðmk  mk1 ; kÞ

By the preceding problem,
S1 ¼ fu1 . . . ; umk2 ; vð1; k  1Þ; . . . ; vðmk  mk1 ; k  1Þg
is a linearly independent subset of Wk1 . We extend S1 to a basis of Wk1 by adjoining new elements (if
necessary), which we denote by
vðmk  mk1 þ 1; k  1Þ;

vðmk  mk1 þ 2; k  1Þ;

...;

vðmk1  mk2 ; k  1Þ

Next we set
vð1; k  2Þ ¼ T vð1; k  1Þ;
vð2; k  2Þ ¼ T vð2; k  1Þ;
vðmk1  mk2 ; k  2Þ ¼ T vðmk1  mk2 ; k  1Þ

...;

338

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms
Again by the preceding problem,
S2 ¼ fu1 ; . . . ; umks ; vð1; k  2Þ; . . . ; vðmk1  mk2 ; k  2Þg
is a linearly independent subset of Wk2 , which we can extend to a basis of Wk2 by adjoining elements
vðmk1  mk2 þ 1; k  2Þ;

vðmk1  mk2 þ 2; k  2Þ;

...;

vðmk2  mk3 ; k  2Þ

Continuing in this manner, we get a new basis for V, which for convenient reference we arrange as follows:
vð1; kÞ
vð1; k  1Þ;
vð1; 2Þ;
vð1; 1Þ;

. . . ; vðmk  mk1 ; kÞ
. . . ; vðmk  mk1 ; k  1Þ . . . ; vðmk1  mk2 ; k  1Þ
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
. . . ; vðmk  mk1 ; 2Þ;
. . . ; vðmk1  mk2 ; 2Þ;
. . . ; vðm2  m1 ; 2Þ
. . . ; vðmk  mk1 ; 1Þ;
. . . ; vðmk1  mk2 ; 1Þ;
. . . ; vðm2  m1 ; 1Þ; . . . ; vðm1 ; 1Þ

The bottom row forms a basis of W1 , the bottom two rows form a basis of W2 , and so forth. But what is
important for us is that T maps each vector into the vector immediately below it in the table or into 0 if the
vector is in the bottom row. That is,
T vði; jÞ ¼

vði; j  1Þ for j > 1
0
for j ¼ 1

Now it is clear [see Problem 10.13(d)] that T will have the desired form if the vði; jÞ are ordered
lexicographically: beginning with vð1; 1Þ and moving up the ﬁrst column to vð1; kÞ, then jumping to vð2; 1Þ
and moving up the second column as far as possible.
Moreover, there will be exactly mk  mk1 diagonal entries of order k: Also, there will be
ðmk1  mk2 Þ  ðmk  mk1 Þ ¼

2mk1  mk  mk2 diagonal entries of order k  1
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
2m2  m1  m3
diagonal entries of order 2
2m1  m2
diagonal entries of order 1

as can be read off directly from the table. In particular, because the numbers m1 ; . . . ; mk are uniquely
determined by T, the number of diagonal entries of each order is uniquely determined by T. Finally, the
identity
m1 ¼ ðmk  mk1 Þ þ ð2mk1  mk  mk2 Þ þ    þ ð2m2  m1  m3 Þ þ ð2m1  m2 Þ
shows that the nullity m1 of T is the total number of diagonal entries of T.

nilpotent matrices MA and MB in canonical form that are similar to A and B, respectively.
Because A and B are nilpotent of index 3, MA and MB must each contain a Jordan nilpotent block of
order 3, and none greater then 3. Note that rankðAÞ ¼ 2 and rankðBÞ ¼ 3, so nullityðAÞ ¼ 5  2 ¼ 3 and
nullityðBÞ ¼ 5  3 ¼ 2. Thus, MA must contain three diagonal blocks, which must be one of order 3 and
two of order 1; and MB must contain two diagonal blocks, which must be one of order 3 and one of order 2.

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms
10.18. Prove Theorem 10.11 on the Jordan canonical form for an operator T.

By the primary decomposition theorem, T is decomposable into operators T1 ; . . . ; Tr ; that is,
T ¼ T1    Tr , where ðt  li Þmi is the minimal polynomial of Ti . Thus, in particular,
ðT1  l1 IÞm1 ¼ 0; . . . ; ðTr  lr IÞmr ¼ 0
Set Ni ¼ Ti  li I. Then, for i ¼ 1; . . . ; r,
Ti ¼ Ni þ li I;

where

i

Nim ¼ 0

That is, Ti is the sum of the scalar operator li I and a nilpotent operator Ni , which is of index mi because
ðt  li Þm
i is the minimal polynomial of Ti .
Now, by Theorem 10.10 on nilpotent operators, we can choose a basis so that Ni is in canonical form.
In this basis, Ti ¼ Ni þ li I is represented by a block diagonal matrix Mi whose diagonal entries are the
matrices Jij . The direct sum J of the matrices Mi is in Jordan canonical form and, by Theorem 10.5, is a
matrix representation of T.
Last, we must show that the blocks Jij satisfy the required properties. Property (i) follows from the fact
that Ni is of index mi . Property (ii) is true because T and J have the same characteristic polynomial. Property
(iii) is true because the nullity of Ni ¼ Ti  li I is equal to the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue li .
Property (iv) follows from the fact that the Ti and hence the Ni are uniquely determined by T.

10.19. Determine all possible Jordan canonical forms J for a linear operator T :V ! V whose
characteristic polynomial DðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ5 and whose minimal polynomial mðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ2 .
J must be a 5 5 matrix, because DðtÞ has degree 5, and all diagonal elements must be 2, because 2 is
the only eigenvalue. Moreover, because the exponent of t  2 in mðtÞ is 2, J must have one Jordan block of
order 2, and the others must be of order 2 or 1. Thus, there are only two possibilities:

10.20. Determine all possible Jordan canonical forms for a linear operator T :V ! V whose characteristic polynomial DðtÞ ¼ ðt  2Þ3 ðt  5Þ2 . In each case, ﬁnd the minimal polynomial mðtÞ.
Because t  2 has exponent 3 in DðtÞ, 2 must appear three times on the diagonal. Similarly, 5 must
appear twice. Thus, there are six possibilities:

Quotient Space and Triangular Form
10.21. Let W be a subspace of a vector space V. Show that the following are equivalent:
(i) u 2 v þ W,

(ii) u  v 2 W,

(iii) v 2 u þ W.

Suppose u 2 v þ W. Then there exists w0 2 W such that u ¼ v þ w0 . Hence, u  v ¼ w0 2 W.
Conversely, suppose u  v 2 W. Then u  v ¼ w0 where w0 2 W. Hence, u ¼ v þ w0 2 v þ W. Thus,
(i) and (ii) are equivalent.
We also have u  v 2 W iff  ðu  vÞ ¼ v  u 2 W iff v 2 u þ W. Thus, (ii) and (iii) are also
equivalent.

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms

10.22. Prove the following: The cosets of W in V partition V into mutually disjoint sets. That is,
(a) Any two cosets u þ W and v þ W are either identical or disjoint.
(b) Each v 2 V belongs to a coset; in fact, v 2 v þ W.
Furthermore, u þ W ¼ v þ W if and only if u  v 2 W, and so ðv þ wÞ þ W ¼ v þ W for any
w 2 W.
Let v 2 V. Because 0 2 W, we have v ¼ v þ 0 2 v þ W, which proves (b).
Now suppose the cosets u þ W and v þ W are not disjoint; say, the vector x belongs to both u þ W
and v þ W. Then u  x 2 W and x  v 2 W. The proof of (a) is complete if we show that u þ W ¼ v þ W.
Let u þ w0 be any element in the coset u þ W. Because u  x, x  v, w0 belongs to W,
ðu þ w0 Þ  v ¼ ðu  xÞ þ ðx  vÞ þ w0 2 W
Thus, u þ w0 2 v þ W, and hence the cost u þ W is contained in the coset v þ W. Similarly, v þ W is
contained in u þ W, and so u þ W ¼ v þ W.
The last statement follows from the fact that u þ W ¼ v þ W if and only if u 2 v þ W, and, by
Problem 10.21, this is equivalent to u  v 2 W.

10.23. Let W be the solution space of the homogeneous equation 2x þ 3y þ 4z ¼ 0. Describe the cosets
of W in R3 .
W is a plane through the origin O ¼ ð0; 0; 0Þ, and the cosets of W are the planes parallel to W.
Equivalently, the cosets of W are the solution sets of the family of equations
2x þ 3y þ 4z ¼ k;
k2R
In fact, the coset v þ W, where v ¼ ða; b; cÞ, is the solution set of the linear equation
2x þ 3y þ 4z ¼ 2a þ 3b þ 4c
or
2ðx  aÞ þ 3ðy  bÞ þ 4ðz  cÞ ¼ 0

10.24. Suppose W is a subspace of a vector space V. Show that the operations in Theorem 10.15 are well
deﬁned; namely, show that if u þ W ¼ u0 þ W and v þ W ¼ v 0 þ W, then
ðaÞ ðu þ vÞ þ W ¼ ðu0 þ v 0 Þ þ W

and

ðbÞ

ku þ W ¼ ku0 þ W

for any k 2 K

(a) Because u þ W ¼ u0 þ W and v þ W ¼ v 0 þ W, both u  u0 and v  v 0 belong to W. But then
ðu þ vÞ  ðu0 þ v 0 Þ ¼ ðu  u0 Þ þ ðv  v 0 Þ 2 W. Hence, ðu þ vÞ þ W ¼ ðu0 þ v 0 Þ þ W.
(b) Also, because u  u0 2 W implies kðu  u0 Þ 2 W, then ku  ku0 ¼ kðu  u0 Þ 2 W ; accordingly,
ku þ W ¼ ku0 þ W.

10.25. Let V be a vector space and W a subspace of V. Show that the natural map Z: V ! V =W, deﬁned
by ZðvÞ ¼ v þ W, is linear.
For any u; v 2 V and any k 2 K, we have
nðu þ vÞ ¼ u þ v þ W ¼ u þ W þ v þ W ¼ ZðuÞ þ ZðvÞ
and
ZðkvÞ ¼ kv þ W ¼ kðv þ W Þ ¼ kZðvÞ
Accordingly, Z is linear.

10.26. Let W be a subspace of a vector space V. Suppose fw1 ; . . . ; wr g is a basis of W and the set of
cosets f
v1 ; . . . ; vs g, where vj ¼ v j þ W, is a basis of the quotient space. Show that the set of
vectors B ¼ fv 1 ; . . . ; v s , w1 ; . . . ; wr g is a basis of V. Thus, dim V ¼ dim W þ dimðV =W Þ.
Suppose u 2 V. Because f
vj g is a basis of V =W,
u ¼ u þ W ¼ a1 v1 þ a2 v2 þ    þ as vs
Hence, u ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ as v s þ w, where w 2 W. Since fwi g is a basis of W,
u ¼ a1 v 1 þ    þ as v s þ b1 w1 þ    þ br wr

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms
Accordingly, B spans V.
We now show that B is linearly independent. Suppose
c1 v 1 þ    þ cs v s þ d1 w1 þ    þ dr wr ¼ 0
0¼W
Then
c1 v1 þ    þ cs vs ¼ 

341

ð1Þ

Because f
vj g is independent, the c’s are all 0. Substituting into (1), we ﬁnd d1 w1 þ    þ dr wr ¼ 0.
Because fwi g is independent, the d’s are all 0. Thus, B is linearly independent and therefore a basis of V.

10.27. Prove Theorem 10.16: Suppose W is a subspace invariant under a linear operator T :V ! V. Then
T induces a linear operator T on V =W deﬁned by Tðv þ W Þ ¼ T ðvÞ þ W. Moreover, if T is a
zero of any polynomial, then so is T. Thus, the minimal polynomial of T divides the minimal
polynomial of T.
We ﬁrst show that T is well deﬁned; that is, if u þ W ¼ v þ W, then Tðu þ W Þ ¼ Tðv þ W Þ. If
u þ W ¼ v þ W, then u  v 2 W, and, as W is T -invariant, T ðu  vÞ ¼ T ðuÞ  T ðvÞ 2 W. Accordingly,
Tðu þ W Þ ¼ T ðuÞ þ W ¼ T ðvÞ þ W ¼ Tðv þ W Þ
as required.
We next show that T is linear. We have
Tððu þ W Þ þ ðv þ W ÞÞ ¼ Tðu þ v þ W Þ ¼ T ðu þ vÞ þ W ¼ T ðuÞ þ T ðvÞ þ W
¼ T ðuÞ þ W þ T ðvÞ þ W ¼ Tðu þ W Þ þ Tðv þ W Þ
Furthermore,
Tðkðu þ W ÞÞ ¼ Tðku þ W Þ ¼ T ðkuÞ þ W ¼ kT ðuÞ þ W ¼ kðT ðuÞ þ W Þ ¼ k T^ðu þ W Þ
Thus, T is linear.
Now, for any coset u þ W in V =W,
T 2 ðu þ W Þ ¼ T 2 ðuÞ þ W ¼ T ðT ðuÞÞ þ W ¼ TðT ðuÞ þ W Þ ¼ TðTðu þ W ÞÞ ¼ T2 ðu þ W Þ
Hence, T 2 ¼ T2 . Similarly, T n ¼ Tn for any n. Thus, for any polynomial

f ðtÞ ¼ an tn þ    þ a0 ¼

f ðT Þðu þ W Þ ¼ f ðT ÞðuÞ þ W ¼

0 ¼ W ¼ f ðTÞ; that is, T is also a root
and so f ðT Þ ¼ f ðTÞ. Accordingly, if T is a root of f ðtÞ then f ðT Þ ¼ 
of f ðtÞ. The theorem is proved.

10.28. Prove Theorem 10.1: Let T :V ! V be a linear operator whose characteristic polynomial factors
into linear polynomials. Then V has a basis in which T is represented by a triangular matrix.
The proof is by induction on the dimension of V. If dim V ¼ 1, then every matrix representation of T
is a 1 1 matrix, which is triangular.
Now suppose dim V ¼ n > 1 and that the theorem holds for spaces of dimension less than n. Because
the characteristic polynomial of T factors into linear polynomials, T has at least one eigenvalue and so at
least one nonzero eigenvector v, say T ðvÞ ¼ a11 v. Let W be the one-dimensional subspace spanned by v.
Set V ¼ V =W. Then (Problem 10.26) dim V ¼ dim V  dim W ¼ n  1. Note also that W is invariant
under T. By Theorem 10.16, T induces a linear operator T on V whose minimal polynomial divides the
minimal polynomial of T. Because the characteristic polynomial of T is a product of linear polynomials,
so is its minimal polynomial, and hence, so are the minimal and characteristic polynomials of T. Thus, V
and T satisfy the hypothesis of the theorem. Hence, by induction, there exists a basis f
v2 ; . . . ; vn g of V
such that
Tð
v2 Þ ¼ a22 v2

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms
Now let v 2 ; . . . ; v n be elements of V that belong to the cosets v 2 ; . . . ; v n , respectively. Then fv; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g
is a basis of V (Problem 10.26). Because Tðv 2 Þ ¼ a22 v2 , we have
Tð
v2 Þ  a22 v22 ¼ 0;
and so
T ðv 2 Þ  a22 v 2 2 W
But W is spanned by v; hence, T ðv 2 Þ  a22 v 2 is a multiple of v, say,
and so
T ðv 2 Þ ¼ a21 v þ a22 v 2
T ðv 2 Þ  a22 v 2 ¼ a21 v;
Similarly, for i ¼ 3; . . . ; n
T ðv i Þ  ai2 v 2  ai3 v 3      aii v i 2 W ;

and so

T ðv i Þ ¼ ai1 v þ ai2 v 2 þ    þ aii v i

Thus,
T ðvÞ ¼ a11 v
T ðv 2 Þ ¼ a21 v þ a22 v 2

T ðv n Þ ¼ an1 v þ an2 v 2 þ    þ ann v n
and hence the matrix of T in this basis is triangular.

Cyclic Subspaces, Rational Canonical Form
10.29. Prove Theorem 10.12: Let Zðv; T Þ be a T -cyclic subspace, Tv the restriction of T to Zðv; TÞ, and
mv ðtÞ ¼ tk þ ak1 tk1 þ    þ a0 the T -annihilator of v. Then,
(i) The set fv; T ðvÞ; . . . ; T k1 ðvÞg is a basis of Zðv; T Þ; hence, dim Zðv; T Þ ¼ k.
(ii) The minimal polynomial of Tv is mv ðtÞ.
(iii) The matrix of Tv in the above basis is the companion matrix C ¼ Cðmv Þ of mv ðtÞ [which
has 1’s below the diagonal, the negative of the coefﬁcients a0 ; a1 ; . . . ; ak1 of mv ðtÞ in the
last column, and 0’s elsewhere].
(i) By deﬁnition of mv ðtÞ, T k ðvÞ is the ﬁrst vector in the sequence v, T ðvÞ, T 2 ðvÞ; . . . that, is a linear
combination of those vectors that precede it in the sequence; hence, the set B ¼ fv; T ðvÞ; . . . ; T k1 ðvÞg is
linearly independent. We now only have to show that Zðv; T Þ ¼ LðBÞ, the linear span of B. By the above,
T k ðvÞ 2 LðBÞ. We prove by induction that T n ðvÞ 2 LðBÞ for every n. Suppose n > k and
T n1 ðvÞ 2 LðBÞ—that is, T n1 ðvÞ is a linear combination of v; . . . ; T k1 ðvÞ. Then
T n ðvÞ ¼ T ðT n1 ðvÞÞ is a linear combination of T ðvÞ; . . . ; T k ðvÞ. But T k ðvÞ 2 LðBÞ; hence,
T n ðvÞ 2 LðBÞ for every n. Consequently, f ðT ÞðvÞ 2 LðBÞ for any polynomial f ðtÞ. Thus,
Zðv; T Þ ¼ LðBÞ, and so B is a basis, as claimed.
(ii) Suppose mðtÞ ¼ ts þ bs1 ts1 þ    þ b0 is the minimal polynomial of Tv . Then, because v 2 Zðv; T Þ,
0 ¼ mðTv ÞðvÞ ¼ mðT ÞðvÞ ¼ T s ðvÞ þ bs1 T s1 ðvÞ þ    þ b0 v
Thus, T s ðvÞ is a linear combination of v, T ðvÞ; . . . ; T s1 ðvÞ, and therefore k  s. However,
mv ðT Þ ¼ 0 and so mv ðTv Þ ¼ 0: Then mðtÞ divides mv ðtÞ; and so s  k: Accordingly, k ¼ s and
hence mv ðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ.

10.30. Let T :V ! V be linear. Let W be a T -invariant subspace of V and T the induced operator on
V =W. Prove
(a) The T-annihilator of v 2 V divides the minimal polynomial of T.
(b) The T-annihilator of v 2 V =W divides the minimal polynomial of T.

343

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms

(a) The T -annihilator of v 2 V is the minimal polynomial of the restriction of T to Zðv; T Þ; therefore, by
Problem 10.6, it divides the minimal polynomial of T.
(b) The T-annihilator of v 2 V =W divides the minimal polynomial of T, which divides the minimal
polynomial of T by Theorem 10.16.
Remark: In the case where the minimum polynomial of T is f ðtÞn , where f ðtÞ is a monic irreducible
polynomial, then the T -annihilator of v 2 V and the T-annihilator of v 2 V =W are of the form f ðtÞm , where
m  n.

10.31. Prove Lemma 10.13: Let T :V ! V be a linear operator whose minimal polynomial is f ðtÞn ,
where f ðtÞ is a monic irreducible polynomial. Then V is the direct sum of T -cyclic subspaces
Zi ¼ Zðv i ; T Þ, i ¼ 1; . . . ; r, with corresponding T -annihilators
f ðtÞn1 ; f ðtÞn2 ; . . . ; f ðtÞnr ;

n ¼ n1  n2      nr

Any other decomposition of V into the direct sum of T -cyclic subspaces has the same number of
components and the same set of T -annihilators.
The proof is by induction on the dimension of V. If dim V ¼ 1, then V is T -cyclic and the lemma
holds. Now suppose dim V > 1 and that the lemma holds for those vector spaces of dimension less than
that of V.
Because the minimal polynomial of T is f ðtÞn , there exists v 1 2 V such that f ðT Þn1 ðv 1 Þ 6¼ 0; hence,
the T -annihilator of v 1 is f ðtÞn . Let Z1 ¼ Zðv 1 ; T Þ and recall that Z1 is T -invariant. Let V ¼ V =Z1 and let T
be the linear operator on V induced by T. By Theorem 10.16, the minimal polynomial of T divides f ðtÞn ;
hence, the hypothesis holds for V and T. Consequently, by induction, V is the direct sum of T-cyclic
subspaces; say,
vr ; T Þ
V ¼ Zð
v2 ; TÞ    Zð
where the corresponding T-annihilators are f ðtÞn2 ; . . . ; f ðtÞnr , n  n2      nr .
We claim that there is a vector v 2 in the coset v2 whose T -annihilator is f ðtÞn2 , the T-annihilator of v2 .
Let w be any vector in v2 . Then f ðT Þn2 ðwÞ 2 Z1 . Hence, there exists a polynomial gðtÞ for which
f ðT Þn2 ðwÞ ¼ gðT Þðv 1 Þ

ð1Þ

n

Because f ðtÞ is the minimal polynomial of T, we have, by (1),
0 ¼ f ðT Þn ðwÞ ¼ f ðT Þnn2 gðT Þðv 1 Þ
But f ðtÞn is the T -annihilator of v 1 ; hence, f ðtÞn divides f ðtÞnn2 gðtÞ, and so gðtÞ ¼ f ðtÞn2 hðtÞ for some
polynomial hðtÞ. We set
v 2 ¼ w  hðT Þðv 1 Þ
Because w  v 2 ¼ hðT Þðv 1 Þ 2 Z1 , v 2 also belongs to the coset v2 . Thus, the T -annihilator of v 2 is a
multiple of the T-annihilator of v2 . On the other hand, by (1),
f ðT Þn2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ f ðT Þns ðw  hðT Þðv 1 ÞÞ ¼ f ðT Þn2 ðwÞ  gðT Þðv 1 Þ ¼ 0
Consequently, the T -annihilator of v 2 is f ðtÞn2 , as claimed.
Similarly, there exist vectors v 3 ; . . . ; v r 2 V such that v i 2 v i and that the T -annihilator of v i is f ðtÞni ,
the T-annihilator of v i . We set
Z2 ¼ Zðv 2 ; T Þ;

...;

Zr ¼ Zðv r ; T Þ

ni

Let d denote the degree of f ðtÞ, so that f ðtÞ has degree dni . Then, because f ðtÞni is both the T -annihilator
of v i and the T-annihilator of v i , we know that
and
f
vi :Tðv i Þ; . . . ; Tdni 1 ðv i Þg
fv i ; T ðv i Þ; . . . ; T dni 1 ðv i Þg
are bases for Zðv i ; T Þ and Zðv i ; TÞ, respectively, for i ¼ 2; . . . ; r. But V ¼ Zðv 2 ; TÞ
hence,

 Therefore, by Problem 10.26 and the relation Ti ð
is a basis for V.
v Þ ¼ T i ðvÞ (see Problem 10.27),
fv 1 ; . . . ; T dn1 1 ðv 1 Þ; v 2 ; . . . ; T en2 1 ðv 2 Þ; . . . ; v r ; . . . ; T dnr 1 ðv r Þg
is a basis for V. Thus, by Theorem 10.4, V ¼ Zðv 1 ; T Þ    Zðv r ; T Þ, as required.
It remains to show that the exponents n1 ; . . . ; nr are uniquely determined by T. Because
d ¼ degree of f ðtÞ;
dim V ¼ dðn1 þ    þ nr Þ

and

dim Zi ¼ dni ;

i ¼ 1; . . . ; r

s

Also, if s is any positive integer, then (Problem 10.59) f ðT Þ ðZi Þ is a cyclic subspace generated by
f ðT Þs ðv i Þ, and it has dimension dðni  sÞ if ni > s and dimension 0 if ni  s.
Now any vector v 2 V can be written uniquely in the form v ¼ w1 þ    þ wr , where wi 2 Zi .
Hence, any vector in f ðT Þs ðV Þ can be written uniquely in the form
f ðT Þs ðvÞ ¼ f ðT Þs ðw1 Þ þ    þ f ðT Þs ðwr Þ
where f ðT Þs ðwi Þ 2 f ðT Þs ðZi Þ. Let t be the integer, dependent on s, for which
n1 > s;
...;
nt > s;
ntþ1  s

Then
f ðT Þ ðV Þ ¼ f ðT Þ ðZ1 Þ    f ðT Þs ðZt Þ
and so

dim½ f ðT Þs ðV Þ ¼ d½ðn1  sÞ þ    þ ðnt  sÞ

ð2Þ

The numbers on the left of (2) are uniquely determined by T. Set s ¼ n  1, and (2) determines the number
of ni equal to n. Next set s ¼ n  2, and (2) determines the number of ni (if any) equal to n  1. We repeat
the process until we set s ¼ 0 and determine the number of ni equal to 1. Thus, the ni are uniquely
determined by T and V, and the lemma is proved.

10.32. Let V be a seven-dimensional vector space over R, and let T :V ! V be a linear operator with
minimal polynomial mðtÞ ¼ ðt2  2t þ 5Þðt  3Þ3 . Find all possible rational canonical forms M
of T.
Because dim V ¼ 7; there are only two possible characteristic polynomials, D1 ðtÞ ¼ ðt2  2t þ 5Þ2
ðt  3Þ3 or D1 ðtÞ ¼ ðt2  2t þ 5Þðt  3Þ5 : Moreover, the sum of the orders of the companion matrices
must add up to 7. Also, one companion matrix must be Cðt2  2t þ 5Þ and one must be Cððt  3Þ3 Þ ¼
Cðt3  9t2 þ 27t  27Þ. Thus, M must be one of the following block diagonal matrices:

Projections
10.33. Suppose V ¼ W1    Wr . The projection of V into its subspace Wk is the mapping E: V ! V
deﬁned by EðvÞ ¼ wk , where v ¼ w1 þ    þ wr ; wi 2 Wi . Show that (a) E is linear, (b) E2 ¼ E.
(a) Because the sum v ¼ w1 þ    þ wr , wi 2 W is uniquely determined by v, the mapping E is well
deﬁned. Suppose, for u 2 V, u ¼ w01 þ    þ w0r , w0i 2 Wi . Then
v þ u ¼ ðw1 þ w01 Þ þ    þ ðwr þ w0r Þ
and
kv ¼ kw1 þ    þ kwr ; kwi ; wi þ w0i 2 Wi
are the unique sums corresponding to v þ u and kv. Hence,
and
EðkvÞ ¼ kwk þ kEðvÞ
Eðv þ uÞ ¼ wk þ w0k ¼ EðvÞ þ EðuÞ
and therefore E is linear.

345

CHAPTER 10 Canonical Forms
(b) We have that
wk ¼ 0 þ    þ 0 þ wk þ 0 þ    þ 0
is the unique sum corresponding to wk 2 Wk ; hence, Eðwk Þ ¼ wk . Then, for any v 2 V,
E2 ðvÞ ¼ EðEðvÞÞ ¼ Eðwk Þ ¼ wk ¼ EðvÞ
Thus, E2 ¼ E, as required.

10.34. Suppose E:V ! V is linear and E2 ¼ E. Show that (a) EðuÞ ¼ u for any u 2 Im E (i.e., the
restriction of E to its image is the identity mapping); (b) V is the direct sum of the image and
kernel of E:V ¼ Im E Ker E; (c) E is the projection of V into Im E, its image. Thus, by the
preceding problem, a linear mapping T :V ! V is a projection if and only if T 2 ¼ T ; this
characterization of a projection is frequently used as its deﬁnition.
(a) If u 2 Im E, then there exists v 2 V for which EðvÞ ¼ u; hence, as required,
EðuÞ ¼ EðEðvÞÞ ¼ E 2 ðvÞ ¼ EðvÞ ¼ u
(b) Let v 2 V. We can write v in the form v ¼ EðvÞ þ v  EðvÞ. Now EðvÞ 2 Im E and, because
Eðv  EðvÞÞ ¼ EðvÞ  E 2 ðvÞ ¼ EðvÞ  EðvÞ ¼ 0
v  EðvÞ 2 Ker E. Accordingly, V ¼ Im E þ Ker E.
Now suppose w 2 Im E \ Ker E. By (i), EðwÞ ¼ w because w 2 Im E. On the other hand,
EðwÞ ¼ 0 because w 2 Ker E. Thus, w ¼ 0, and so Im E \ Ker E ¼ f0g. These two conditions
imply that V is the direct sum of the image and kernel of E.
(c) Let v 2 V and suppose v ¼ u þ w, where u 2 Im E and w 2 Ker E. Note that EðuÞ ¼ u by (i), and
EðwÞ ¼ 0 because w 2 Ker E. Hence,
EðvÞ ¼ Eðu þ wÞ ¼ EðuÞ þ EðwÞ ¼ u þ 0 ¼ u
That is, E is the projection of V into its image.

10.35. Suppose V ¼ U W and suppose T :V ! V is linear. Show that U and W are both T -invariant if
and only if TE ¼ ET , where E is the projection of V into U.
Observe that EðvÞ 2 U for every v 2 V, and that (i) EðvÞ ¼ v iff v 2 U , (ii) EðvÞ ¼ 0 iff v 2 W.
Suppose ET ¼ TE. Let u 2 U . Because EðuÞ ¼ u,
T ðuÞ ¼ T ðEðuÞÞ ¼ ðTEÞðuÞ ¼ ðET ÞðuÞ ¼ EðT ðuÞÞ 2 U
Hence, U is T -invariant. Now let w 2 W. Because EðwÞ ¼ 0,
EðT ðwÞÞ ¼ ðETÞðwÞ ¼ ðTEÞðwÞ ¼ T ðEðwÞÞ ¼ T ð0Þ ¼ 0;

and so

T ðwÞ 2 W

Hence, W is also T -invariant.
Conversely, suppose U and W are both T -invariant. Let v 2 V and suppose v ¼ u þ w, where u 2 T
and w 2 W. Then T ðuÞ 2 U and T ðwÞ 2 W ; hence, EðT ðuÞÞ ¼ T ðuÞ and EðT ðwÞÞ ¼ 0. Thus,

and

ðET ÞðvÞ ¼ ðET Þðu þ wÞ ¼ ðET ÞðuÞ þ ðET ÞðwÞ ¼ EðT ðuÞÞ þ EðT ðwÞÞ ¼ T ðuÞ
ðTEÞðvÞ ¼ ðTEÞðu þ wÞ ¼ T ðEðu þ wÞÞ ¼ T ðuÞ

That is, ðETÞðvÞ ¼ ðTEÞðvÞ for every v 2 V ; therefore, ET ¼ TE, as required.

Linear Functionals
and the Dual Space
11.1

Introduction

In this chapter, we study linear mappings from a vector space V into its ﬁeld K of scalars. (Unless
otherwise stated or implied, we view K as a vector space over itself.) Naturally all the theorems and
results for arbitrary mappings on V hold for this special case. However, we treat these mappings
separately because of their fundamental importance and because the special relationship of V to K gives
rise to new notions and results that do not apply in the general case.

11.2

Linear Functionals and the Dual Space

Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K. A mapping f:V ! K is termed a linear functional (or linear form)
if, for every u; v 2 V and every a; b; 2 K,
fðau þ bvÞ ¼ afðuÞ þ bfðvÞ
In other words, a linear functional on V is a linear mapping from V into K.
EXAMPLE 11.1

(a) Let pi :K n ! K be the ith projection mapping; that is, pi ða1 ; a2 ; . . . an Þ ¼ ai . Then pi is linear and so it is a linear
functional on K n .
(b) Let V be Ðthe vector space of polynomials in t over R. Let J:V ! R be the integral operator deﬁned by
1
JðpðtÞÞ ¼ 0 pðtÞ dt. Recall that J is linear; and hence, it is a linear functional on V.
(c) Let V be the vector space of n-square matrices over K. Let T :V ! K be the trace mapping

T ðAÞ ¼ a11 þ a22 þ    þ ann ;

where

A ¼ ½aij 

That is, T assigns to a matrix A the sum of its diagonal elements. This map is linear (Problem 11.24), and so it is
a linear functional on V.

By Theorem 5.10, the set of linear functionals on a vector space V over a ﬁeld K is also a vector
space over K, with addition and scalar multiplication deﬁned by
ðf þ sÞðvÞ ¼ fðvÞ þ sðvÞ

and

ðkfÞðvÞ ¼ kfðvÞ

where f and s are linear functionals on V and k 2 K. This space is called the dual space of V and is
denoted by V *.
Let V ¼ K n , the vector space of n-tuples, which we write as column vectors. Then the dual space V * can
be identiﬁed with the space of row vectors. In particular, any linear functional f ¼ ða1 ; . . . ; an Þ in V * has the representation
EXAMPLE 11.2

fðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ ¼ ½a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; an ½x2 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn T ¼ a1 x1 þ a2 x2 þ    þ an xn
Historically, the formal expression on the right was termed a linear form.

CHAPTER 11 Linear Functionals and the Dual Space

Dual Basis

Suppose V is a vector space of dimension n over K. By Theorem 5.11, the dimension of the dual space V *
is also n (because K is of dimension 1 over itself). In fact, each basis of V determines a basis of V * as
follows (see Problem 11.3 for the proof).
THEOREM 11.1:

Suppose fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g is a basis of V over K. Let f1 ; . . . ; fn 2 V * be the linear
functionals as deﬁned by
1 if i ¼ j
fi ðv j Þ ¼ dij ¼
0 if i 6¼ j
Then ff1 ; . . . ; fn g is a basis of V *:

The above basis ffi g is termed the basis dual to fv i g or the dual basis. The above formula, which
uses the Kronecker delta dij , is a short way of writing
f1 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 1; f1 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0; f1 ðv 3 Þ ¼ 0; . . . ; f1 ðv n Þ ¼ 0
f2 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0; f2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 1; f2 ðv 3 Þ ¼ 0; . . . ; f2 ðv n Þ ¼ 0
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
fn ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0; fn ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0; . . . ; fn ðv n1 Þ ¼ 0; fn ðv n Þ ¼ 1
By Theorem 5.2, these linear mappings fi are unique and well deﬁned.
EXAMPLE 11.3 Consider the basis fv 1 ¼ ð2; 1Þ; v 2 ¼ ð3; 1Þg of R2 . Find the dual basis ff1 ; f2 g.

We seek linear functionals f1 ðx; yÞ ¼ ax þ by and f2 ðx; yÞ ¼ cx þ dy such that

f1 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 1;

f1 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0;

f2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0;

f2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 1

These four conditions lead to the following two systems of linear equations:

f1 ðv 1 Þ ¼ f1 ð2; 1Þ ¼ 2a þ b ¼ 1
f1 ðv 2 Þ ¼ f1 ð3; 1Þ ¼ 3a þ b ¼ 0

and

f2 ðv 1 Þ ¼ f2 ð2; 1Þ ¼ 2c þ d ¼ 0
f2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ f2 ð3; 1Þ ¼ 3c þ d ¼ 1

The solutions yield a ¼ 1, b ¼ 3 and c ¼ 1, d ¼ 2. Hence, f1 ðx; yÞ ¼ x þ 3y and f2 ðx; yÞ ¼ x  2y form the
dual basis.

The next two theorems (proved in Problems 11.4 and 11.5, respectively) give relationships between
bases and their duals.
THEOREM 11.2:

Let fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g be a basis of V and let ff1 ; . . . ; fn g be the dual basis in V *. Then
(i) For any vector u 2 V, u ¼ f1 ðuÞv 1 þ f2 ðuÞv 2 þ    þ fn ðuÞv n .
(ii) For any linear functional s 2 V *, s ¼ sðv 1 Þf1 þ sðv 2 Þf2 þ    þ sðv n Þfn .

THEOREM 11.3:

11.4

Let fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g and fw1 ; . . . ; wn g be bases of V and let ff1 ; . . . ; fn g and
fs1 ; . . . ; sn g be the bases of V * dual to fv i g and fwi g, respectively. Suppose P is
the change-of-basis matrix from fv i g to fwi g. Then ðP1 ÞT is the change-of-basis
matrix from ffi g to fsi g.

Second Dual Space

We repeat: Every vector space V has a dual space V *, which consists of all the linear functionals on V.
Thus, V * has a dual space V **, called the second dual of V, which consists of all the linear functionals
on V *.
We now show that each v 2 V determines a speciﬁc element v^ 2 V **. First, for any f 2 V *, we deﬁne
v^ðfÞ ¼ fðvÞ

CHAPTER 11 Linear Functionals and the Dual Space

It remains to be shown that this map v^:V * ! K is linear. For any scalars a; b 2 K and any linear
functionals f; s 2 V *, we have
v^ðaf þ bsÞ ¼ ðaf þ bsÞðvÞ ¼ afðvÞ þ bsðvÞ ¼ a^
v ðfÞ þ b^
v ðsÞ
That is, v^ is linear and so v^ 2 V **. The following theorem (proved in Problem 12.7) holds.
THEOREM 11.4:

If V has ﬁnite dimensions, then the mapping v 7! v^ is an isomorphism of V
onto V **.

The above mapping v 7! v^ is called the natural mapping of V into V **. We emphasize that this
mapping is never onto V ** if V is not ﬁnite-dimensional. However, it is always linear, and moreover, it is
always one-to-one.
Now suppose V does have ﬁnite dimension. By Theorem 11.4, the natural mapping determines an
isomorphism between V and V **. Unless otherwise stated, we will identify V with V ** by this
mapping. Accordingly, we will view V as the space of linear functionals on V * and write V ¼ V **. We
remark that if ffi g is the basis of V * dual to a basis fv i g of V, then fv i g is the basis of V ** ¼ V that is
dual to ffi g.

11.5

Annihilators

Let W be a subset (not necessarily a subspace) of a vector space V. A linear functional f 2 V * is called
an annihilator of W if fðwÞ ¼ 0 for every w 2 W—that is, if fðW Þ ¼ f0g. We show that the set of all
such mappings, denoted by W 0 and called the annihilator of W, is a subspace of V *. Clearly, 0 2 W 0 :
Now suppose f; s 2 W 0 . Then, for any scalars a; b; 2 K and for any w 2 W,
ðaf þ bsÞðwÞ ¼ afðwÞ þ bsðwÞ ¼ a0 þ b0 ¼ 0
Thus, af þ bs 2 W 0 , and so W 0 is a subspace of V *.
In the case that W is a subspace of V, we have the following relationship between W and its annihilator
W 0 (see Problem 11.11 for the proof).
THEOREM 11.5:

Suppose V has ﬁnite dimension and W is a subspace of V. Then

ðiÞ dim W þ dim W 0 ¼ dim V

and

ðiiÞ W 00 ¼ W

Here W 00 ¼ fv 2 V :fðvÞ ¼ 0 for every f 2 W 0 g or, equivalently, W 00 ¼ ðW 0 Þ0 , where W 00 is viewed
as a subspace of V under the identiﬁcation of V and V **.

11.6

Transpose of a Linear Mapping

Let T :V ! U be an arbitrary linear mapping from a vector space V into a vector space U . Now for any
linear functional f 2 U *, the composition f  T is a linear mapping from V into K:

That is, f  T 2 V *. Thus, the correspondence
f 7! f  T
is a mapping from U * into V *; we denote it by T t and call it the transpose of T . In other words,
T t :U * ! V * is deﬁned by
T t ðfÞ ¼ f  T
Thus, ðT t ðfÞÞðvÞ ¼ fðT ðvÞÞ for every v 2 V.

352

CHAPTER 11 Linear Functionals and the Dual Space

THEOREM 11.6:

The transpose mapping T t deﬁned above is linear.

Proof. For any scalars a; b 2 K and any linear functionals f; s 2 U *,
T t ðaf þ bsÞ ¼ ðaf þ bsÞ  T ¼ aðf  T Þ þ bðs  T Þ ¼ aT t ðfÞ þ bT t ðsÞ
That is, T t is linear, as claimed.
We emphasize that if T is a linear mapping from V into U , then T t is a linear mapping from U * into
V *. The same ‘‘transpose’’ for the mapping T t no doubt derives from the following theorem (proved in
Problem 11.16).
THEOREM 11.7:

Let T :V ! U be linear, and let A be the matrix representation of T relative to bases
fv i g of V and fui g of U . Then the transpose matrix AT is the matrix representation of
T t :U * ! V * relative to the bases dual to fui g and fv i g.

Find the basis ff1 ; f2 ; f3 g that is dual to the following basis of R3 :
fv 1 ¼ ð1; 1; 3Þ; v 2 ¼ ð0; 1; 1Þ; v 3 ¼ ð0; 3; 2Þg
The linear functionals may be expressed in the form
f1 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ a1 x þ a2 y þ a3 z;

f2 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ b1 x þ b2 y þ b3 z;

f3 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ c1 x þ c2 y þ c3 z

By deﬁnition of the dual basis, fi ðv j Þ ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j, but fi ðv j Þ ¼ 1 for i ¼ j.
We ﬁnd f1 by setting f1 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 1; f1 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0; f1 ðv 3 Þ ¼ 0: This yields
f1 ð1; 1; 3Þ ¼ a1  a2 þ 3a3 ¼ 1;

f1 ð0; 1; 1Þ ¼ a2  a3 ¼ 0;

f1 ð0; 3; 2Þ ¼ 3a2  2a3 ¼ 0

Solving the system of equations yields a1 ¼ 1, a2 ¼ 0, a3 ¼ 0. Thus, f1 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ x.
We ﬁnd f2 by setting f2 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0, f2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 1, f2 ðv 3 Þ ¼ 0. This yields
f2 ð1; 1; 3Þ ¼ b1  b2 þ 3b3 ¼ 0;

f2 ð0; 1; 1Þ ¼ b2  b3 ¼ 1;

f2 ð0; 3; 2Þ ¼ 3b2  2b3 ¼ 0

Solving the system of equations yields b1 ¼ 7, b2 ¼ 2, a3 ¼ 3. Thus, f2 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 7x  2y  3z.
We ﬁnd f3 by setting f3 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0, f3 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0, f3 ðv 3 Þ ¼ 1. This yields
f3 ð1; 1; 3Þ ¼ c1  c2 þ 3c3 ¼ 0;

f3 ð0; 1; 1Þ ¼ c2  c3 ¼ 0;

f3 ð0; 3; 2Þ ¼ 3c2  2c3 ¼ 1

Solving the system of equations yields c1 ¼ 2, c2 ¼ 1, c3 ¼ 1. Thus, f3 ðx; y; zÞ ¼ 2x þ y þ z.

Let V ¼ fa þ bt : a; b 2 Rg, the vector space of real polynomials of degree  1. Find the basis

Let v 1 ¼ a þ bt and v 2 ¼ c þ dt. By deﬁnition of the dual basis,
f1 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 1;

f1 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0

and

f2 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0;

fi ðv j Þ ¼ 1

and

f1 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0 ðc þ dtÞ dt ¼ c þ 12 d ¼ 0
Ð2
f2 ðv 2 Þ ¼ 0 ðc þ dtÞ dt ¼ 2c þ 2d ¼ 1

Thus,

Ð1
f1 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0 ða þ btÞ dt ¼ a þ 12 b ¼ 1
Ð2
f2 ðv 1 Þ ¼ 0 ða þ btÞ dt ¼ 2a þ 2b ¼ 0

Solving each system yields a ¼ 2, b ¼ 2 and c ¼  12, d ¼ 1. Thus, fv 1 ¼ 2  2t; v 2 ¼  12 þ tg is
the basis of V that is dual to ff1 ; f2 g.

Prove Theorem 11.1: Suppose fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g is a basis of V over K. Let f1 ; . . . ; fn 2 V * be
deﬁned by fi ðv j Þ ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j, but fi ðv j Þ ¼ 1 for i ¼ j. Then ff1 ; . . . ; fn g is a basis of V *.
We ﬁrst show that ff1 ; . . . ; fn g spans V *. Let f be an arbitrary element of V *, and suppose
fðv 1 Þ ¼ k1 ;

fðv 2 Þ ¼ k2 ;

...;

fðv n Þ ¼ kn

Set s ¼ k1 f1 þ    þ kn fn . Then
sðv 1 Þ ¼ ðk1 f1 þ    þ kn fn Þðv 1 Þ ¼ k1 f1 ðv 1 Þ þ k2 f2 ðv 1 Þ þ    þ kn fn ðv 1 Þ
¼ k 1  1 þ k 2  0 þ    þ kn  0 ¼ k 1
Similarly, for i ¼ 2; . . . ; n,
sðv i Þ ¼ ðk1 f1 þ    þ kn fn Þðv i Þ ¼ k1 f1 ðv i Þ þ    þ ki fi ðv i Þ þ    þ kn fn ðv i Þ ¼ ki
Thus, fðv i Þ ¼ sðv i Þ for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n. Because f and s agree on the basis
f ¼ s ¼ k1 f1 þ    þ kn fn . Accordingly, ff1 ; . . . ; fn g spans V *.
It remains to be shown that ff1 ; . . . ; fn g is linearly independent. Suppose

vectors,

a1 f1 þ a2 f2 þ    þ an fn ¼ 0
Applying both sides to v 1 , we obtain
0 ¼ 0ðv 1 Þ ¼ ða1 f1 þ    þ an fn Þðv 1 Þ ¼ a1 f1 ðv 1 Þ þ a2 f2 ðv 1 Þ þ    þ an fn ðv 1 Þ

Similarly, for i ¼ 2; . . . ; n,
0 ¼ 0ðv i Þ ¼ ða1 f1 þ    þ an fn Þðv i Þ ¼ a1 f1 ðv i Þ þ    þ ai fi ðv i Þ þ    þ an fn ðv i Þ ¼ ai
That is, a1 ¼ 0; . . . ; an ¼ 0. Hence, ff1 ; . . . ; fn g is linearly independent, and so it is a basis of V *.

11.4.

Prove Theorem 11.2: Let fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g be a basis
. . ; fn g be the dual basis in
P of V and let ff1 ; .P
V *. For any u 2 V and any s 2 V *, (i) u ¼ i fi ðuÞv i . (ii) s ¼ i fðv i Þfi .
Suppose
u ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ an v n

ð1Þ

Then
f1 ðuÞ ¼ a1 f1 ðv 1 Þ þ a2 f1 ðv 2 Þ þ    þ an f1 ðv n Þ ¼ a1  1 þ a2  0 þ    þ an  0 ¼ a1
Similarly, for i ¼ 2; . . . ; n,
fi ðuÞ ¼ a1 fi ðv 1 Þ þ    þ ai fi ðv i Þ þ    þ an fi ðv n Þ ¼ ai
That is, f1 ðuÞ ¼ a1 , f2 ðuÞ ¼ a2 ; . . . ; fn ðuÞ ¼ an . Substituting these results into (1), we obtain (i).
Next we prove ðiiÞ. Applying the linear functional s to both sides of (i),
sðuÞ ¼ f1 ðuÞsðv 1 Þ þ f2 ðuÞsðv 2 Þ þ    þ fn ðuÞsðv n Þ

Because the above holds for every u 2 V, s ¼ sðv 1 Þf2 þ sðv 2 Þf2 þ    þ sðv n Þfn , as claimed.

11.5.

Prove Theorem 11.3. Let fv i g and fwi g be bases of V and let ffi g and fsi g be the respective
dual bases in V *. Let P be the change-of-basis matrix from fv i g to fwi g: Then ðP1 ÞT is the
change-of-basis matrix from ffi g to fsi g.
Suppose, for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n,

and

si ¼ bi1 f1 þ bi2 f2 þ    þ ain v n

Then P ¼ ½aij  and Q ¼ ½bij . We seek to prove that Q ¼ ðP1 ÞT .
Let Ri denote the ith row of Q and let Cj denote the jth column of PT . Then
Ri ¼ ðbi1 ; bi2 ; . . . ; bin Þ

and

Cj ¼ ðaj1 ; aj2 ; . . . ; ajn ÞT

354

where dij is the Kronecker delta. Thus,
QPT ¼ ½Ri Cj  ¼ ½dij  ¼ I
Therefore, Q ¼ ðPT Þ1 ¼ ðP1 ÞT , as claimed.

11.6.

Suppose v 2 V, v 6¼ 0, and dim V ¼ n. Show that there exists f 2 V * such that fðvÞ 6¼ 0.
We extend fvg to a basis fv; v 2 ; . . . ; v n g of V. By Theorem 5.2, there exists a unique linear mapping
f:V ! K such that fðvÞ ¼ 1 and fðv i Þ ¼ 0, i ¼ 2; . . . ; n. Hence, f has the desired property.

11.7.

Prove Theorem 11.4: Suppose dim V ¼ n. Then the natural mapping v 7! v^ is an isomorphism of
V onto V **.
We ﬁrst prove that the map v 7! v^ is linear—that is, for any vectors v; w 2 V and any scalars a; b 2 K,
d
av
þ bw ¼ a^
v þ bw.
^ For any linear functional f 2 V *,

d
^
^
av
þ bwðfÞ ¼ fðav þ bwÞ ¼ afðvÞ þ bfðwÞ ¼ a^
v ðfÞ þ bwðfÞ
¼ ða^
v þ bwÞðfÞ
d
d
^ Thus, the map
^
þ bw ¼ a^
v þ bw.
Because av
þ bwðfÞ ¼ ða^
v þ bwÞðfÞ
for every f 2 V *, we have av
v 7! v^ is linear.
Now suppose v 2 V, v 6¼ 0. Then, by Problem 11.6, there exists f 2 V * for which fðvÞ 6¼ 0. Hence,
v^ðfÞ ¼ fðvÞ 6¼ 0, and thus v^ 6¼ 0. Because v 6¼ 0 implies v^ 6¼ 0, the map v 7! v^ is nonsingular and hence
an isomorphism (Theorem 5.64).
Now dim V ¼ dim V * ¼ dim V **, because V has ﬁnite dimension. Accordingly, the mapping v 7! v^
is an isomorphism of V onto V **.

Annihilators
11.8.

Show that if f 2 V * annihilates a subset S of V, then f annihilates the linear span LðSÞ of S.
Hence, S 0 ¼ ½spanðSÞ0 .
Suppose v 2 spanðSÞ. Then there exists w1 ; . . . ; wr 2 S for which v ¼ a1 w1 þ a2 w2 þ    þ ar wr .
fðvÞ ¼ a1 fðw1 Þ þ a2 fðw2 Þ þ    þ ar fðwr Þ ¼ a1 0 þ a2 0 þ    þ ar 0 ¼ 0
Because v was an arbitrary element of spanðSÞ; f annihilates spanðSÞ, as claimed.

11.9.

Find a basis of the annihilator W 0 of the subspace W of R4 spanned by
v 1 ¼ ð1; 2; 3; 4Þ and

v 2 ¼ ð0; 1; 4; 1Þ

By Problem 11.8, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a basis of the set of linear functionals f such that fðv 1 Þ ¼ 0 and
fðv 2 Þ ¼ 0, where fðx1 ; x2 ; x3 ; x4 Þ ¼ ax1 þ bx2 þ cx3 þ dx4 . Thus,
fð1; 2; 3; 4Þ ¼ a þ 2b  3c þ 4d ¼ 0

and

fð0; 1; 4; 1Þ ¼ b þ 4c  d ¼ 0

The system of two equations in the unknowns a; b; c; d is in echelon form with free variables c and d.
(1) Set c ¼ 1, d ¼ 0 to obtain the solution a ¼ 11, b ¼ 4, c ¼ 1, d ¼ 0.
(2) Set c ¼ 0, d ¼ 1 to obtain the solution a ¼ 6, b ¼ 1, c ¼ 0, d ¼ 1.
The linear functions f1 ðxi Þ ¼ 11x1  4x2 þ x3 and f2 ðxi Þ ¼ 6x1  x2 þ x4 form a basis of W 0 .

11.10. Show that (a)

For any subset S of V ; S  S 00 . (b) If S1  S2 , then S20  S10 .

(a) Let v 2 S. Then for every linear functional f 2 S 0 , v^ðfÞ ¼ fðvÞ ¼ 0. Hence, v^ 2 ðS 0 Þ0 . Therefore,
under the identiﬁcation of V and V **, v 2 S 00 . Accordingly, S  S 00 .
(b) Let f 2 S20 . Then fðvÞ ¼ 0 for every v 2 S2 . But S1  S2 ; hence, f annihilates every element of S1
(i.e., f 2 S10 ). Therefore, S20  S10 .

11.11. Prove Theorem 11.5: Suppose V has ﬁnite dimension and W is a subspace of V. Then
(i) dim W þ dim W 0 ¼ dim V, (ii) W 00 ¼ W.
(i) Suppose dim V ¼ n and dim W ¼ r  n. We want to show that dim W 0 ¼ n  r. We choose a basis
fw1 ; . . . ; wr g of W and extend it to a basis of V, say fw1 ; . . . ; wr ; v 1 ; . . . ; v nr g. Consider the dual
basis
ff1 ; . . . ; fr ; s1 ; . . . ; snr g
By deﬁnition of the dual basis, each of the above s’s annihilates each wi ; hence, s1 ; . . . ; snr 2 W 0 .
We claim that fsi g is a basis of W 0 . Now fsj g is part of a basis of V *, and so it is linearly
independent.
We next show that ffj g spans W 0 . Let s 2 W 0 . By Theorem 11.2,
s ¼ sðw1 Þf1 þ    þ sðwr Þfr þ sðv 1 Þs1 þ    þ sðv nr Þsnr
¼ 0f1 þ    þ 0fr þ sðv 1 Þs1 þ    þ sðv nr Þsnr
¼ sðv 1 Þs1 þ    þ sðv nr Þsnr
Consequently, fs1 ; . . . ; snr g spans W 0 and so it is a basis of W 0 . Accordingly, as required
dim W 0 ¼ n  r ¼ dim V  dim W :
(ii) Suppose dim V ¼ n and dim W ¼ r. Then dim V * ¼ n and, by (i), dim W 0 ¼ n  r. Thus, by (i),
dim W 00 ¼ n  ðn  rÞ ¼ r; therefore, dim W ¼ dim W 00 . By Problem 11.10, W  W 00 . Accordingly, W ¼ W 00 .

11.12. Let U and W be subspaces of V. Prove that ðU þ W Þ0 ¼ U 0 \ W 0 .
Let f 2 ðU þ W Þ0 . Then f annihilates U þ W; and so, in particular, f annihilates U and W: That is,
f 2 U 0 and f 2 W 0 ; hence, f 2 U 0 \ W 0 : Thus, ðU þ W Þ0  U 0 \ W 0 :
On the other hand, suppose s 2 U 0 \ W 0 : Then s annihilates U and also W. If v 2 U þ W, then
v ¼ u þ w, where u 2 U and w 2 W. Hence, sðvÞ ¼ sðuÞ þ sðwÞ ¼ 0 þ 0 ¼ 0. Thus, s annihilates U þ W;
that is, s 2 ðU þ W Þ0 . Accordingly, U 0 þ W 0  ðU þ W Þ0 .
The two inclusion relations together give us the desired equality.
Remark: Observe that no dimension argument is employed in the proof; hence, the result holds for
spaces of ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimension.

Transpose of a Linear Mapping
11.13. Let f be the linear functional on R2 deﬁned by fðx; yÞ ¼ x  2y. For each of the following linear
operators T on R2 , ﬁnd ðT t ðfÞÞðx; yÞ:
(a) T ðx; yÞ ¼ ðx; 0Þ, (b) T ðx; yÞ ¼ ðy; x þ yÞ,

(c) T ðx; yÞ ¼ ð2x  3y; 5x þ 2yÞ

By deﬁnition, T ðfÞ ¼ f  T ; that is, ðT t ðfÞÞðvÞ ¼ fðT ðvÞÞ for every v. Hence,
t

(a) ðT t ðfÞÞðx; yÞ ¼ fðT ðx; yÞÞ ¼ fðx; 0Þ ¼ x
(b) ðT t ðfÞÞðx; yÞ ¼ fðT ðx; yÞÞ ¼ fðy; x þ yÞ ¼ y  2ðx þ yÞ ¼ 2x  y
(c) ðT t ðfÞÞðx; yÞ ¼ fðT ðx; yÞÞ ¼ fð2x  3y; 5x þ 2yÞ ¼ ð2x  3yÞ  2ð5x þ 2yÞ ¼ 8x  7y

11.14. Let T :V ! U be linear and let T t :U * ! V * be its transpose. Show that the kernel of T t is the
annihilator of the image of T —that is, Ker T t ¼ ðIm T Þ0 .
Suppose f 2 Ker T t ; that is, T t ðfÞ ¼ f  T ¼ 0. If u 2 Im T , then u ¼ T ðvÞ for some v 2 V ; hence,
fðuÞ ¼ fðT ðvÞÞ ¼ ðf  T ÞðvÞ ¼ 0ðvÞ ¼ 0
We have that fðuÞ ¼ 0 for every u 2 Im T ; hence, f 2 ðIm T Þ0 . Thus, Ker T t  ðIm T Þ0 .
On the other hand, suppose s 2 ðIm T Þ0 ; that is, sðIm T Þ ¼ f0g . Then, for every v 2 V,
ðT t ðsÞÞðvÞ ¼ ðs  T ÞðvÞ ¼ sðT ðvÞÞ ¼ 0 ¼ 0ðvÞ

356

CHAPTER 11 Linear Functionals and the Dual Space
We have ðT t ðsÞÞðvÞ ¼ 0ðvÞ for every v 2 V ; hence, T t ðsÞ ¼ 0. Thus, s 2 Ker T t , and so
ðIm T Þ0  Ker T t .
The two inclusion relations together give us the required equality.

Bilinear, Quadratic,
and Hermitian Forms
12.1

Introduction

This chapter generalizes the notions of linear mappings and linear functionals. Speciﬁcally, we introduce
the notion of a bilinear form. These bilinear maps also give rise to quadratic and Hermitian forms.
Although quadratic forms were discussed previously, this chapter is treated independently of the previous
results.
Although the ﬁeld K is arbitrary, we will later specialize to the cases K ¼ R and K ¼ C. Furthermore,
we may sometimes need to divide by 2. In such cases, we must assume that 1 þ 1 6¼ 0, which is true when
K ¼ R or K ¼ C.

12.2

Bilinear Forms

Let V be a vector space of ﬁnite dimension over a ﬁeld K. A bilinear form on V is a mapping
f :V V ! K such that, for all a; b 2 K and all ui ; v i 2 V:
(i) f ðau1 þ bu2 ; vÞ ¼ af ðu1 ; vÞ þ bf ðu2 ; vÞ,
(ii) f ðu; av 1 þ bv 2 Þ ¼ af ðu; v 1 Þ þ bf ðu; v 2 Þ
We express condition (i) by saying f is linear in the ﬁrst variable, and condition (ii) by saying f is linear
in the second variable.
EXAMPLE 12.1

(a) Let f be the dot product on Rn ; that is, for u ¼ ðai Þ and v ¼ ðbi Þ,

f ðu; vÞ ¼ u  v ¼ a1 b1 þ a2 b2 þ    þ an bn
Then f is a bilinear form on Rn . (In fact, any inner product on a real vector space V is a bilinear form
on V.)
(b) Let f and s be arbitrarily linear functionals on V. Let f :V
a bilinear form, because f and s are each linear.

V ! K be deﬁned by f ðu; vÞ ¼ fðuÞsðvÞ. Then f is

(c) Let A ¼ ½aij  be any n n matrix over a ﬁeld K. Then A may be identiﬁed with the following bilinear form F on
K n , where X ¼ ½xi  and Y ¼ ½yi  are column vectors of variables:

f ðX ; Y Þ ¼ X T AY ¼

P
i;j

aij xi yi ¼ a11 x1 y1 þ a12 x1 y2 þ    þ ann xn yn

The above formal expression in the variables xi ; yi is termed the bilinear polynomial corresponding to the matrix
A. Equation (12.1) shows that, in a certain sense, every bilinear form is of this type.

CHAPTER 12 Bilinear, Quadratic, and Hermitian Forms

Space of Bilinear Forms
Let BðV Þ denote the set of all bilinear forms on V. A vector space structure is placed on BðV Þ, where for
any f ; g 2 BðV Þ and any k 2 K, we deﬁne f þ g and kf as follows:
ð f þ gÞðu; vÞ ¼ f ðu; vÞ þ gðu; vÞ

and

ðkf Þðu; vÞ ¼ kf ðu; vÞ

The following theorem (proved in Problem 12.4) applies.
THEOREM 12.1:

12.3

Let V be a vector space of dimension n over K. Let ff1 ; . . . ; fn g be any basis of the
dual space V *. Then f fij : i; j ¼ 1; . . . ; ng is a basis of BðV Þ, where fij is deﬁned by
fij ðu; vÞ ¼ fi ðuÞfj ðvÞ. Thus, in particular, dim BðV Þ ¼ n2 .

Bilinear Forms and Matrices

Let f be a bilinear form on V and let S ¼ fu1 ; . . . ; un g be a basis of V. Suppose u; v 2 V and
u ¼ a1 u1 þ    þ an un

and

v ¼ b1 u1 þ    þ bn un

Then
f ðu; vÞ ¼ f ða1 u1 þ    þ an un ; b1 u1 þ    þ bn un Þ ¼

P
i;j

ai bj f ðui ; uj Þ

Thus, f is completely determined by the n2 values f ðui ; uj Þ.
The matrix A ¼ ½aij  where aij ¼ f ðui ; uj Þ is called the matrix representation of f relative to the basis S
or, simply, the ‘‘matrix of f in S.’’ It ‘‘represents’’ f in the sense that, for all u; v 2 V,
P
ð12:1Þ
f ðu; vÞ ¼ ai bj f ðui ; uj Þ ¼ ½uTS A½vS
i;j

[As usual, ½uS denotes the coordinate (column) vector of u in the basis S.]

Change of Basis, Congruent Matrices
We now ask, how does a matrix representing a bilinear form transform when a new basis is selected? The
answer is given in the following theorem (proved in Problem 12.5).
THEOREM 12.2:

Let P be a change-of-basis matrix from one basis S to another basis S 0 . If A is the
matrix representing a bilinear form f in the original basis S, then B ¼ PT AP is the
matrix representing f in the new basis S 0 .

The above theorem motivates the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

A matrix B is congruent to a matrix A, written B ’ A, if there exists a nonsingular
matrix P such that B ¼ PTAP.

Thus, by Theorem 12.2, matrices representing the same bilinear form are congruent. We remark that
congruent matrices have the same rank, because P and PT are nonsingular; hence, the following deﬁnition
is well deﬁned.
DEFINITION:

12.4

The rank of a bilinear form f on V, written rankð f Þ, is the rank of any matrix
representation of f . We say f is degenerate or nondegenerate according to whether
rankð f Þ < dim V or rankð f Þ ¼ dim V.

Alternating Bilinear Forms

Let f be a bilinear form on V. Then f is called
(i) alternating if f ðv; vÞ ¼ 0 for every v 2 V ;
(ii) skew-symmetric if f ðu; vÞ ¼ f ðv; uÞ for every u; v 2 V.

CHAPTER 12 Bilinear, Quadratic, and Hermitian Forms

361

Now suppose (i) is true. Then (ii) is true, because, for any u; v; 2 V,
0 ¼ f ðu þ v; u þ vÞ ¼ f ðu; uÞ þ f ðu; vÞ þ f ðv; uÞ þ f ðv; vÞ ¼ f ðu; vÞ þ f ðv; uÞ
On the other hand, suppose (ii) is true and also 1 þ 1 6¼ 0. Then (i) is true, because, for every v 2 V, we
have f ðv; vÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ. In other words, alternating and skew-symmetric are equivalent when 1 þ 1 6¼ 0.
The main structure theorem of alternating bilinear forms (proved in Problem 12.23) is as follows.
THEOREM 12.3:

Let f be an alternating bilinear form on V. Then there exists a basis of V in which f
is represented by a block diagonal matrix M of the form

1 0
1 0
Moreover, the number of nonzero blocks is uniquely determined by f [because it is
equal to 12 rankð f Þ.

In particular, the above theorem shows that any alternating bilinear form must have even rank.

12.5

Symmetric Bilinear Forms, Quadratic Forms

This section investigates the important notions of symmetric bilinear forms and quadratic forms and their
representation by means of symmetric matrices. The only restriction on the ﬁeld K is that 1 þ 1 6¼ 0. In
Section 12.6, we will restrict K to be the real ﬁeld R, which yields important special results.

Symmetric Bilinear Forms
Let f be a bilinear form on V. Then f is said to be symmetric if, for every u; v 2 V,
f ðu; vÞ ¼ f ðv; uÞ
One can easily show that f is symmetric if and only if any matrix representation A of f is a symmetric
matrix.
The main result for symmetric bilinear forms (proved in Problem 12.10) is as follows. (We emphasize
that we are assuming that 1 þ 1 6¼ 0.)
THEOREM 12.4:

Let f be a symmetric bilinear form on V. Then V has a basis fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g in which f
is represented by a diagonal matrix—that is, where f ðv i ; v j Þ ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j.

THEOREM 12.4:

(Alternative Form) Let A be a symmetric matrix over K. Then A is congruent to a
diagonal matrix; that is, there exists a nonsingular matrix P such that PTAP is
diagonal.

Diagonalization Algorithm
Recall that a nonsingular matrix P is a product of elementary matrices. Accordingly, one way of
obtaining the diagonal form D ¼ PTAP is by a sequence of elementary row operations and the same
sequence of elementary column operations. This same sequence of elementary row operations on the
identity matrix I will yield PT . This algorithm is formalized below.
ALGORITHM 12.1:

(Congruence Diagonalization of a Symmetric Matrix) The input is a symmetric
matrix A ¼ ½aij  of order n.

Step 1. Form the n 2n (block) matrix M ¼ ½A1 ; I, where A1 ¼ A is the left half of M and the identity
matrix I is the right half of M.
Step 2. Examine the entry a11 . There are three cases.

For i ¼ 2; . . . ; n:

Case I:

(a) Apply the row operation ‘‘Replace Ri by ai1 R1 þ a11 Ri .’’
(b) Apply the corresponding column operation ‘‘Replace Ci by ai1 C1 þ a11 Ci .’’
These operations reduce the matrix M to the form

a11 ¼ 0 but akk 6¼ 0, for some k > 1.

Case II:

(a) Apply the row operation ‘‘Interchange R1 and Rk .’’
(b) Apply the corresponding column operation ‘‘Interchange C1 and Ck .’’
(These operations bring akk into the ﬁrst diagonal position, which reduces the matrix
to Case I.)
Case III: All diagonal entries aii ¼ 0 but some aij 6¼ 0.
(a) Apply the row operation ‘‘Replace Ri by Rj þ Ri .’’
(b) Apply the corresponding column operation ‘‘Replace Ci by Cj þ Ci .’’
(These operations bring 2aij into the ith diagonal position, which reduces the matrix
to Case II.)
Thus, M is ﬁnally reduced to the form ð*Þ, where A2 is a symmetric matrix of order less than
A.
Step 3. Repeat Step 2 with each new matrix Ak (by neglecting the ﬁrst row and column of the
preceding matrix) until A is diagonalized. Then M is transformed into the form M 0 ¼ ½D; Q,
where D is diagonal.
Step 4. Set P ¼ QT . Then D ¼ PTAP.
Remark 1: We emphasize that in Step 2, the row operations will change both sides of M, but the
column operations will only change the left half of M.
Remark 2: The condition 1 þ 1 6¼ 0 is used in Case III, where we assume that 2aij 6¼ 0 when
aij 6¼ 0.
The justiﬁcation for the above algorithm appears in Problem 12.9.

Quadratic Forms
We begin with a deﬁnition.
DEFINITION A:

A mapping q:V ! K is a quadratic form if qðvÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ for some symmetric
bilinear form f on V.

If 1 þ 1 6¼ 0 in K, then the bilinear form f can be obtained from the quadratic form q by the following
polar form of f :
f ðu; vÞ ¼ 12 ½qðu þ vÞ  qðuÞ  qðvÞ
Now suppose f is represented by a symmetric matrix A ¼ ½aij , and 1 þ 1 6¼ 0. Letting X ¼ ½xi 
denote a column vector of variables, q can be represented in the form
P
P
P
qðX Þ ¼ f ðX ; X Þ ¼ X T AX ¼ aij xi xj ¼ aii x2i þ 2 aij xi xj
i;j

i

i<j

The above formal expression in the variables xi is also called a quadratic form. Namely, we have the
following second deﬁnition.
DEFINITION B:

A quadratic form q in variables x1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn is a polynomial such that every term
has degree two; that is,
P
P
qðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ ¼ ci x2i þ dij xi xj
i

i<j

Using 1 þ 1 6¼ 0, the quadratic form q in Deﬁnition B determines a symmetric matrix A ¼ ½aij  where
aii ¼ ci and aij ¼ aji ¼ 12 dij . Thus, Deﬁnitions A and B are essentially the same.
If the matrix representation A of q is diagonal, then q has the diagonal representation
qðX Þ ¼ X T AX ¼ a11 x21 þ a22 x22 þ    þ ann x2n
That is, the quadratic polynomial representing q will contain no ‘‘cross product’’ terms. Moreover, by
Theorem 12.4, every quadratic form has such a representation (when 1 þ 1 6¼ 0Þ.

Real Symmetric Bilinear Forms, Law of Inertia

This section treats symmetric bilinear forms and quadratic forms on vector spaces V over the real ﬁeld R.
The special nature of R permits an independent theory. The main result (proved in Problem 12.14) is as
follows.
THEOREM 12.5:

Let f be a symmetric form on V over R. Then there exists a basis of V in which f is
represented by a diagonal matrix. Every other diagonal matrix representation of f has
the same number p of positive entries and the same number n of negative entries.

364

CHAPTER 12 Bilinear, Quadratic, and Hermitian Forms

The above result is sometimes called the Law of Inertia or Sylvester’s Theorem. The rank and
signature of the symmetric bilinear form f are denoted and deﬁned by
rankð f Þ ¼ p þ n

and

sigð f Þ ¼ p  n

These are uniquely deﬁned by Theorem 12.5.
A real symmetric bilinear form f is said to be
(i) positive deﬁnite if qðvÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ > 0 for every v 6¼ 0,
(ii) nonnegative semideﬁnite if qðvÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ  0 for every v.
EXAMPLE 12.3 Let f be the dot product on Rn . Recall that f is a symmetric bilinear form on Rn . We note

Section 12.5 and Chapter 13 tell us how to diagonalize a real quadratic form q or, equivalently, a real
symmetric matrix A by means of an orthogonal transition matrix P. If P is merely nonsingular, then q can
be represented in diagonal form with only 1’s and 1’s as nonzero coefﬁcients. Namely, we have the
following corollary.
COROLLARY 12.6:

Any real quadratic form q has a unique representation in the form
qðx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn Þ ¼ x21 þ    þ x2p  x2pþ1      x2r
where r ¼ p þ n is the rank of the form.

COROLLARY 12.6:

(Alternative Form) Any real symmetric matrix A is congruent to the unique
diagonal matrix
D ¼ diagðIp ; In ; 0Þ
where r ¼ p þ n is the rank of A.

12.7

Hermitian Forms

Let V be a vector space of ﬁnite dimension over the complex ﬁeld C. A Hermitian form on V is a
mapping f :V V ! C such that, for all a; b 2 C and all ui ; v 2 V,
(i) f ðau1 þ bu2 ; vÞ ¼ af ðu1 ; vÞ þ bf ðu2 ; vÞ,
(ii) f ðu; vÞ ¼ f ðv; uÞ.
(As usual, k denotes the complex conjugate of k 2 C.)
Using (i) and (ii), we get
f ðu; av 1 þ bv 2 Þ ¼ f ðav 1 þ bv 2 ; uÞ ¼ af ðv 1 ; uÞ þ bf ðv 2 ; uÞ
 ðu; v 2 Þ
¼ a^f ðv 1 ; uÞ þ bf ðv 2 ; uÞ ¼ af ðu; v 1 Þ þ bf
That is,
 ðu; v 2 Þ:
ðiiiÞ f ðu; av 1 þ bv 2 Þ ¼ af ðu; v 1 Þ þ bf
As before, we express condition (i) by saying f is linear in the ﬁrst variable. On the other hand, we
express condition (iii) by saying f is ‘‘conjugate linear’’ in the second variable. Moreover, condition (ii)
tells us that f ðv; vÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ, and hence, f ðv; vÞ is real for every v 2 V.
The results of Sections 12.5 and 12.6 for symmetric forms have their analogues for Hermitian forms.
Thus, the mapping q:V ! R, deﬁned by qðvÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ, is called the Hermitian quadratic form or
complex quadratic form associated with the Hermitian form f . We can obtain f from q by the polar form
f ðu; vÞ ¼ 14 ½qðu þ vÞ  qðu  vÞ þ 14 ½qðu þ ivÞ  qðu  ivÞ

CHAPTER 12 Bilinear, Quadratic, and Hermitian Forms

Now suppose S ¼ fu1 ; . . . ; un g is a basis of V. The matrix H ¼ ½hij  where hij ¼ f ðui ; uj Þ is called the
matrix representation of f in the basis S. By (ii), f ðui ; uj Þ ¼ f ðuj ; ui Þ; hence, H is Hermitian and, in
particular, the diagonal entries of H are real. Thus, any diagonal representation of f contains only real
entries.
The next theorem (to be proved in Problem 12.47) is the complex analog of Theorem 12.5 on real
symmetric bilinear forms.
THEOREM 12.7:

Let f be a Hermitian form on V over C. Then there exists a basis of V in which f is
represented by a diagonal matrix. Every other diagonal matrix representation of f
has the same number p of positive entries and the same number n of negative
entries.

Again the rank and signature of the Hermitian form f are denoted and deﬁned by
rankð f Þ ¼ p þ n

and

sigð f Þ ¼ p  n

These are uniquely deﬁned by Theorem 12.7.
Analogously, a Hermitian form f is said to be
(i) positive deﬁnite if qðvÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ > 0 for every v 6¼ 0,
(ii) nonnegative semideﬁnite if qðvÞ ¼ f ðv; vÞ  0 for every v.

1 þ z2 w
2 þ    þ zn w
n
f ðu; vÞ ¼ u  v ¼ z1 w
Then f is a Hermitian form on Cn . Moreover, f is also positive deﬁnite, because, for any u ¼ ðzi Þ 6¼ 0 in Cn ,

f ðu; uÞ ¼ z1 z1 þ z2 z2 þ    þ zn zn ¼ jz1 j2 þ jz2 j2 þ    þ jzn j2 > 0

Prove Theorem 12.1: Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over K. Let ff1 ; . . . ; fn g be any

Let fu1 ; . . . ; un g be the basis of V dual P

The last step follows as above. Thus, f fij g is independent, and hence is a basis of BðV Þ.

Prove Theorem 12.2. Let P be the change-of-basis matrix from a basis S to a basis S 0 . Let A be
the matrix representing a bilinear form in the basis S. Then B ¼ PTAP is the matrix representing
f in the basis S 0 .
Let u; v 2 V. Because P is the change-of-basis matrix from S to S 0 , we have P½uS 0 ¼ ½uS and also
P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS ; hence, ½uTS ¼ ½uTS0 PT . Thus,
f ðu; vÞ ¼ ½uTS A½vS ¼ ½uTS0 PT AP½vS 0
Because u and v are arbitrary elements of V, PTAP is the matrix of f in the basis S 0 .

The symmetric matrix A ¼ ½aij  that represents qðx1 ; . . . ; xn Þ has the diagonal entry aii equal to the

the diagonal elements of A, and the coefﬁcient 6 of the cross-product term xy is the sum of
the nondiagonal elements 3 and 3 of A (or twice the nondiagonal element 3, because A is

Justify Algorithm 12.1, which diagonalizes (under congruence) a symmetric matrix A.
Consider the block matrix M ¼ ½A; I. The algorithm applies a sequence of elementary row operations
and the corresponding column operations to the left side of M, which is the matrix A. This is equivalent to
premultiplying A by a sequence of elementary matrices, say, E1 ; E2 ; . . . ; Er , and postmultiplying A by the
transposes of the Ei . Thus, when the algorithm ends, the diagonal matrix D on the left side of M is equal to
D ¼ Er    E2 E1 AE1T E2T    ErT ¼ QAQT ;

where

Q ¼ Er    E2 E1

On the other hand, the algorithm only applies the elementary row operations to the identity matrix I on the
right side of M. Thus, when the algorithm ends, the matrix on the right side of M is equal to
Er    E2 E1 I ¼ Er    E2 E1 ¼ Q
Setting P ¼ QT , we get D ¼ PTAP, which is a diagonalization of A under congruence.

12.10. Prove Theorem 12.4: Let f be a symmetric bilinear form on V over K (where 1 þ 1 6¼ 0). Then
V has a basis in which f is represented by a diagonal matrix.
Algorithm 12.1 shows that every symmetric matrix over K is congruent to a diagonal matrix. This is
equivalent to the statement that f has a diagonal representation.

12.11. Let q be the quadratic form associated with the symmetric bilinear form f . Verify the polar
identity f ðu; vÞ ¼ 12 ½qðu þ vÞ  qðuÞ  qðvÞ. (Assume that 1 þ 1 6¼ 0.)

of V in which f is represented by a diagonal matrix. Every other diagonal matrix representation

By Theorem 12.4, there is a basis fu1 ; . . . ; un g of V in which f is represented by a diagonal matrix
with, say, p positive and n negative entries. Now suppose fw1 ; . . . ; wn g is another basis of V, in which f is
represented by a diagonal matrix with p0 positive and n0 negative entries. We can assume without loss of
generality that the positive entries in each matrix appear ﬁrst. Because rankð f Þ ¼ p þ n ¼ p0 þ n0 , it
sufﬁces to prove that p ¼ p0 .

CHAPTER 12 Bilinear, Quadratic, and Hermitian Forms
Let U be the linear span of u1 ; . . . ; up and let W be the linear span of wp0 þ1 ; . . . ; wn . Then f ðv; vÞ > 0
for every nonzero v 2 U , and f ðv; vÞ  0 for every nonzero v 2 W. Hence, U \ W ¼ f0g. Note that
dim U ¼ p and dim W ¼ n  p0 . Thus,
dimðU þ W Þ ¼ dim U þ dimW  dimðU \ W Þ ¼ p þ ðn  p0 Þ  0 ¼ p  p0 þ n
But dimðU þ W Þ  dim V ¼ n; hence, p  p0 þ n  n or p  p0 . Similarly, p0  p and therefore p ¼ p0 ,
as required.

Remark: The above theorem and proof depend only on the concept of positivity. Thus, the
theorem is true for any subﬁeld K of the real ﬁeld R such as the rational ﬁeld Q.

Positive Deﬁnite Real Quadratic Forms
12.15. Prove that the following deﬁnitions of a positive deﬁnite quadratic form q are equivalent:
(a) The diagonal entries are all positive in any diagonal representation of q.
(b) qðY Þ > 0, for any nonzero vector Y in Rn .
Suppose qðY Þ ¼ a1 y21 þ a2 y22 þ    þ an y2n . If all the coefﬁcients are positive, then clearly qðY Þ > 0
whenever Y 6¼ 0. Thus, (a) implies (b). Conversely, suppose (a) is not true; that is, suppose some diagonal
entry ak  0. Let ek ¼ ð0; . . . ; 1; . . . 0Þ be the vector whose entries are all 0 except 1 in the kth position.
Then qðek Þ ¼ ak is not positive, and so (b) is not true. That is, (b) implies (a). Accordingly, (a) and (b) are
equivalent.

(b) qðx; y; zÞ ¼ x2 þ y2 þ 2xz þ 4yz þ 3z2
Diagonalize (under congruence) the symmetric matrix A corresponding to q.
(a) Apply the operations ‘‘Replace R3 by 2R1 þ R3 ’’ and ‘‘Replace C3 by 2C1 þ C3 ,’’ and then ‘‘Replace

D ¼ b2  4ac < 0.
Suppose v ¼ ðx; yÞ 6¼ 0. Then either x 6¼ 0 or y 6¼ 0; say, y 6¼ 0. Let t ¼ x=y. Then

However, the following are equivalent:

(ii) s ¼ at2 þ bt þ c lies above the t-axis.
(iii) a > 0 and D ¼ b2  4ac < 0.

Thus, q is positive deﬁnite if and only if a > 0 and D < 0. [Remark: D < 0 is the same as detðAÞ > 0,
where A is the symmetric matrix corresponding to q.]

12.18. Determine whether or not each of the following quadratic forms q is positive deﬁnite:

Compute the discriminant D ¼ b2  4ac, and then use Problem 12.17.
(a) D ¼ 16  28 ¼ 12. Because a ¼ 1 > 0 and D < 0; q is positive deﬁnite.
(b) D ¼ 64  20 ¼ 44. Because D > 0; q is not positive deﬁnite.
(c) D ¼ 4  12 ¼ 8. Because a ¼ 3 > 0 and D < 0; q is positive deﬁnite.

A complex matrix A ¼ ½aij  is Hermitian if A* ¼ A—that is, if aij ¼ aji :
(a) Yes, because it is equal to its conjugate transpose.
(b) No, even though it is symmetric.
(c) Yes. In fact, a real matrix is Hermitian if and only if it is symmetric.

12.20. Let A be a Hermitian matrix. Show that f is a Hermitian form on Cn where f is deﬁned by
f ðX ; Y Þ ¼ X TAY.
For all a; b 2 C and all X1 ; X2 ; Y 2 Cn ,
f ðaX1 þ bX2 ; Y Þ ¼ ðaX1 þ bX2 ÞT AY ¼ ðaX1T þ bX2T ÞAY

Hence, f is linear in the ﬁrst variable. Also,
f ðX ; Y Þ ¼ X TAY ¼ ðX TAYÞT ¼ YT AT X ¼ Y T A*X ¼ Y T AX ¼ f ðY ; X Þ
Hence, f is a Hermitian form on Cn .

Remark: We use the fact that X T AY is a scalar and so it is equal to its transpose.

(a) f ðu; vÞ ¼ ½uTS H½vS for all u; v 2 V.
(b) If P is the change-of-basis matrix from S to a new basis S 0 of V, then B ¼ PT H P (or

(b) Because P is the change-of-basis matrix from S to S 0 , we have P½uS 0 ¼ ½uS and P½vS 0 ¼ ½vS ; hence,

Miscellaneous Problems
12.23. Prove Theorem 12.3: Let f be an alternating form on V. Then there exists
a basis

 of V in which f
0 1
or 0. The number
is represented by a block diagonal matrix M with blocks of the form
1 0
1
of nonzero blocks is uniquely determined by f [because it is equal to 2 rankð f Þ.
If f ¼ 0, then the theorem is obviously true. Also, if dim V ¼ 1, then f ðk1 u; k2 uÞ ¼ k1 k2 f ðu; uÞ ¼ 0
and so f ¼ 0. Accordingly, we can assume that dim V > 1 and f 6¼ 0.
Because f 6¼ 0, there exist (nonzero) u1 ; u2 2 V such that f ðu1 ; u2 Þ 6¼ 0. In fact, multiplying u1 by
an appropriate factor, we can assume that f ðu1 ; u2 Þ ¼ 1 and so f ðu2 ; u1 Þ ¼ 1. Now u1 and u2 are
linearly independent; because if, say, u2 ¼ ku1 , then f ðu1 ; u2 Þ ¼ f ðu1 ; ku1 Þ ¼ kf ðu1 ; u1 Þ ¼ 0. Let
U ¼ spanðu1 ; u2 Þ; then,

Let W consists of those vectors w 2 V such that f ðw; u1 Þ ¼ 0 and f ðw; u2 Þ ¼ 0: Equivalently,
W ¼ fw 2 V : f ðw; uÞ ¼ 0 for every u 2 U g
We claim that V ¼ U
v 2 V. Set

W. It is clear that U \ W ¼ f0g, and so it remains to show that V ¼ U þ W. Let
u ¼ f ðv; u2 Þu1  f ðv; u1 Þu2

and

w¼vu

ð1Þ

Because u is a linear combination of u1 and u2 ; u 2 U.
We show next that w 2 W. By (1) and (ii), f ðu; u1 Þ ¼ f ðv; u1 Þ; hence,
f ðw; u1 Þ ¼ f ðv  u; u1 Þ ¼ f ðv; u1 Þ  f ðu; u1 Þ ¼ 0
Similarly, f ðu; u2 Þ ¼ f ðv; u2 Þ and so
f ðw; u2 Þ þ f ðv  u; u2 Þ ¼ f ðv; u2 Þ  f ðu; u2 Þ ¼ 0
Then w 2 W and so, by (1), v ¼ u þ w, where u 2 W. This shows that V ¼ U þ W ; therefore, V ¼ U W.
Now the restriction of f to W is an alternating bilinear form on W. By induction, there exists a basis
u3 ; . . . ; un of W in which the matrix representing f restricted to W has the desired form. Accordingly,
u1 ; u2 ; u3 ; . . . ; un is a basis of V in which the matrix representing f has the desired form.

Linear Operators on Inner
Product Spaces
13.1

Introduction

This chapter investigates the space AðV Þ of linear operators T on an inner product space V. (See
Chapter 7.) Thus, the base ﬁeld K is either the real numbers R or the complex numbers C. In fact, different
terminologies will be used for the real case and the complex case. We also use the fact that the inner
products on real Euclidean space Rn and complex Euclidean space Cn may be deﬁned, respectively, by
hu; vi ¼ uT v

and

hu; vi ¼ uT v

where u and v are column vectors.
The reader should review the material in Chapter 7 and be very familiar with the notions of norm
(length), orthogonality, and orthonormal bases. We also note that Chapter 7 mainly dealt with real inner
product spaces, whereas here we assume that V is a complex inner product space unless otherwise stated
or implied.
Lastly, we note that in Chapter 2, we used AH to denote the conjugate transpose of a complex matrix A;
that is, AH ¼ AT . This notation is not standard. Many texts, expecially advanced texts, use A* to denote
such a matrix; we will use that notation in this chapter. That is, now A* ¼ AT .

13.2

Adjoint Operators

We begin with the following basic deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

A linear operator T on an inner product space V is said to have an adjoint operator T *
on V if hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; T *ðvÞi for every u; v 2 V.

The following example shows that the adjoint operator has a simple description within the context of
matrix mappings.
EXAMPLE 13.1

(a)

Let A be a real n-square matrix viewed as a linear operator on Rn . Then, for every u; v 2 Rn ;

hAu; vi ¼ ðAuÞT v ¼ uT AT v ¼ hu; AT vi
Thus, the transpose AT of A is the adjoint of A.
(b) Let B be a complex n-square matrix viewed as a linear operator on Cn . Then for every u; v; 2 Cn ,

hBu; vi ¼ ðBuÞT v ¼ uT BT v ¼ uT B*
v ¼ hu; B*vi
Thus, the conjugate transpose B* of B is the adjoint of B.

CHAPTER 13

Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces

Remark: B* may mean either the adjoint of B as a linear operator or the conjugate transpose of B
as a matrix. By Example 13.1(b), the ambiguity makes no difference, because they denote the same
object.
The following theorem (proved in Problem 13.4) is the main result in this section.
THEOREM 13.1:

Let T be a linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V over K.
Then
(i) There exists a unique linear operator T * on V such that hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; T *ðvÞi
for every u; v 2 V. (That is, T has an adjoint T *.)
(ii) If A is the matrix representation T with respect to any orthonormal basis
S ¼ fui g of V, then the matrix representation of T * in the basis S is the
conjugate transpose A* of A (or the transpose AT of A when K is real).

We emphasize that no such simple relationship exists between the matrices representing T and T * if
the basis is not orthonormal. Thus, we see one useful property of orthonormal bases. We also emphasize
that this theorem is not valid if V has inﬁnite dimension (Problem 13.31).
The following theorem (proved in Problem 13.5) summarizes some of the properties of the adjoint.
THEOREM 13.2:

Let T ; T1 ; T2 be linear operators on V and let k 2 K. Then
(i) ðT1 þ T2 Þ* ¼ T1* þ T2*,
 *,
(ii) ðkT Þ* ¼ kT

(iii) ðT1 T2 Þ* ¼ T2*T1*,
(iv) ðT *Þ* ¼ T.

Observe the similarity between the above theorem and Theorem 2.3 on properties of the transpose
operation on matrices.

Linear Functionals and Inner Product Spaces
Recall (Chapter 11) that a linear functional f on a vector space V is a linear mapping f:V ! K. This
subsection contains an important result (Theorem 13.3) that is used in the proof of the above basic
Theorem 13.1.
Let V be an inner product space. Each u 2 V determines a mapping u^:V ! K deﬁned by
u^ðvÞ ¼ hv; ui
Now, for any a; b 2 K and any v 1 ; v 2 2 V,
u^ðav 1 þ bv 2 Þ ¼ hav 1 þ bv 2 ; ui ¼ ahv 1 ; ui þ bhv 2 ; ui ¼ a^
uðv 1 Þ þ b^
uðv 2 Þ
That is, u^ is a linear functional on V. The converse is also true for spaces of ﬁnite dimension and it is
contained in the following important theorem (proved in Problem 13.3).
THEOREM 13.3:

Let f be a linear functional on a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V. Then
there exists a unique vector u 2 V such that fðvÞ ¼ hv; ui for every v 2 V.

We remark that the above theorem is not valid for spaces of inﬁnite dimension (Problem 13.24).

13.3

Analogy Between AðVÞ and C, Special Linear Operators

Let AðV Þ denote the algebra of all linear operators on a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V. The
adjoint mapping T 7! T * on AðV Þ is quite analogous to the conjugation mapping z 7! z on the complex
ﬁeld C. To illustrate this analogy we identify in Table 13-1 certain classes of operators T 2 AðV Þ whose
behavior under the adjoint map imitates the behavior under conjugation of familiar classes of complex
numbers.
The analogy between these operators T and complex numbers z is reﬂected in the next theorem.

If T * ¼ T 1 (i.e., T is orthogonal or unitary), then jlj ¼ 1.
If T * ¼ T (i.e., T is self-adjoint), then l is real.
If T * ¼ T (i.e., T is skew-adjoint), then l is pure imaginary.
If T ¼ S*S with S nonsingular (i.e., T is positive deﬁnite), then l is real and
positive.

Proof. In each case let v be a nonzero eigenvector of T belonging to l; that is, T ðvÞ ¼ lv with
v 6¼ 0. Hence, hv; vi is positive.
Proof of (i). We show that llhv; vi ¼ hv; vi:
llhv; vi ¼ hlv; lvi ¼ hT ðvÞ; T ðvÞi ¼ hv; T *T ðvÞi ¼ hv; IðvÞi ¼ hv; vi
But hv; vi 6¼ 0; hence, ll ¼ 1 and so jlj ¼ 1.
Proof of (ii). We show that lhv; vi ¼ lhv; vi:
lhv; vi ¼ hlv; vi ¼ hT ðvÞ; vi ¼ hv; T *ðvÞi ¼ hv; T ðvÞi ¼ hv; lvi ¼ lhv; vi
But hv; vi 6¼ 0; hence, l ¼ l and so l is real.
Proof of (iii). We show that lhv; vi ¼ lhv; vi:
lhv; vi ¼ hlv; vi ¼ hT ðvÞ; vi ¼ hv; T *ðvÞi ¼ hv; T ðvÞi ¼ hv; lvi ¼ lhv; vi
But hv; vi 6¼ 0; hence, l ¼ l or l ¼ l, and so l is pure imaginary.
Proof of (iv). Note ﬁrst that SðvÞ 6¼ 0 because S is nonsingular; hence, hSðvÞ, SðvÞi is positive. We
show that lhv; vi ¼ hSðvÞ; SðvÞi:
lhv; vi ¼ hlv; vi ¼ hT ðvÞ; vi ¼ hS*SðvÞ; vi ¼ hSðvÞ; SðvÞi
But hv; vi and hSðvÞ; SðvÞi are positive; hence, l is positive.

CHAPTER 13

Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces

Remark: Each of the above operators T commutes with its adjoint; that is, TT * ¼ T*T. Such
operators are called normal operators.

13.4

Self-Adjoint Operators

Let T be a self-adjoint operator on an inner product space V ; that is, suppose
T* ¼ T
(If T is deﬁned by a matrix A, then A is symmetric or Hermitian according as A is real or complex.) By
Theorem 13.4, the eigenvalues of T are real. The following is another important property of T.
THEOREM 13.5:

Let T be a self-adjoint operator on V. Suppose u and v are eigenvectors of T
belonging to distinct eigenvalues. Then u and v are orthogonal; that is, hu; vi ¼ 0.

Proof. Suppose T ðuÞ ¼ l1 u and T ðvÞ ¼ l2 v, where l1 6¼ l2 . We show that l1 hu; vi ¼ l2 hu; vi:
l1 hu; vi ¼ hl1 u; vi ¼ hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; T *ðvÞi ¼ hu; T ðvÞi
¼ hu; l vi ¼ l hu; vi ¼ l hu; vi
2

(The fourth equality uses the fact that T* ¼ T, and the last equality uses the fact that the eigenvalue l2 is
real.) Because l1 6¼ l2 , we get hu; vi ¼ 0. Thus, the theorem is proved.

13.5

Orthogonal and Unitary Operators

Let U be a linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V. Suppose
U * ¼ U 1

or equivalently

UU * ¼ U *U ¼ I

Recall that U is said to be orthogonal or unitary according as the underlying ﬁeld is real or complex. The
next theorem (proved in Problem 13.10) gives alternative characterizations of these operators.
THEOREM 13.6:

The following conditions on an operator U are equivalent:
(i) U * ¼ U 1 ; that is, UU * ¼ U *U ¼ I. [U is unitary (orthogonal).]
(ii) U preserves inner products; that is, for every v; w 2 V,
hU ðvÞ, U ðwÞi ¼ hv; wi.
(iii) U preserves lengths; that is, for every v 2 V, kU ðvÞk ¼ kvk.

EXAMPLE 13.2

(a) Let T :R3 ! R3 be the linear operator that rotates each vector v about the z-axis by a ﬁxed angle y as shown in
Fig. 10-1 (Section 10.3). That is, T is deﬁned by

T ðx; y; zÞ ¼ ðx cos y  y sin y; x sin y þ y cos y; zÞ
We note that lengths (distances from the origin) are preserved under T. Thus, T is an orthogonal operator.
(b) Let V be l2 -space (Hilbert space), deﬁned in Section 7.3. Let T :V ! V be the linear operator deﬁned by

T ða1 ; a2 ; a3 ; . . .Þ ¼ ð0; a1 ; a2 ; a3 ; . . .Þ
Clearly, T preserves inner products and lengths. However, T is not surjective, because, for example, ð1; 0; 0; . . .Þ
does not belong to the image of T ; hence, T is not invertible. Thus, we see that Theorem 13.6 is not valid for
spaces of inﬁnite dimension.

An isomorphism from one inner product space into another is a bijective mapping that preserves the
three basic operations of an inner product space: vector addition, scalar multiplication, and inner

CHAPTER 13 Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces

381

products. Thus, the above mappings (orthogonal and unitary) may also be characterized as the
isomorphisms of V into itself. Note that such a mapping U also preserves distances, because
kU ðvÞ  U ðwÞk ¼ kU ðv  wÞk ¼ kv  wk
Hence, U is called an isometry.

13.6

Orthogonal and Unitary Matrices

Let U be a linear operator on an inner product space V. By Theorem 13.1, we obtain the following results.
THEOREM 13.7A:

A complex matrix A represents a unitary operator U (relative to an orthonormal
basis) if and only if A* ¼ A1 .

THEOREM 13.7B:

A real matrix A represents an orthogonal operator U (relative to an orthonormal
basis) if and only if AT ¼ A1 .

The above theorems motivate the following deﬁnitions (which appeared in Sections 2.10 and 2.11).
DEFINITION:

A complex matrix A for which A* ¼ A1 is called a unitary matrix.

DEFINITION:

A real matrix A for which AT ¼ A1 is called an orthogonal matrix.

We repeat Theorem 2.6, which characterizes the above matrices.
THEOREM 13.8:

The following conditions on a matrix A are equivalent:
(i) A is unitary (orthogonal).
(ii) The rows of A form an orthonormal set.
(iii) The columns of A form an orthonormal set.

13.7

Change of Orthonormal Basis

Orthonormal bases play a special role in the theory of inner product spaces V. Thus, we are naturally
interested in the properties of the change-of-basis matrix from one such basis to another. The following
theorem (proved in Problem 13.12) holds.
THEOREM 13.9:

Let fu1 ; . . . ; un g be an orthonormal basis of an inner product space V. Then the
change-of-basis matrix from fui g into another orthonormal basis is unitary
(orthogonal). Conversely, if P ¼ ½aij  is a unitary (orthogonal) matrix, then the
following is an orthonormal basis:
fu0i ¼ a1i u1 þ a2i u2 þ    þ ani un : i ¼ 1; . . . ; ng

Recall that matrices A and B representing the same linear operator T are similar; that is, B ¼ P1 AP,
where P is the (nonsingular) change-of-basis matrix. On the other hand, if V is an inner product space, we
are usually interested in the case when P is unitary (or orthogonal) as suggested by Theorem 13.9. (Recall
that P is unitary if the conjugate tranpose P* ¼ P1 , and P is orthogonal if the transpose PT ¼ P1 .) This
leads to the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION:

Complex matrices A and B are unitarily equivalent if there exists a unitary matrix P
for which B ¼ P*AP. Analogously, real matrices A and B are orthogonally equivalent
if there exists an orthogonal matrix P for which B ¼ PTAP.

Note that orthogonally equivalent matrices are necessarily congruent.

CHAPTER 13

Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces

Positive Deﬁnite and Positive Operators

Let P be a linear operator on an inner product space V. Then
(i) P is said to be positive deﬁnite if P ¼ S*S for some nonsingular operators S:
(ii) P is said to be positive (or nonnegative or semideﬁnite) if P ¼ S*S for some operator S:
The following theorems give alternative characterizations of these operators.
THEOREM 13.10A:

The following conditions on an operator P are equivalent:
(i) P ¼ T 2 for some nonsingular self-adjoint operator T.
(ii) P is positive deﬁnite.
(iii) P is self-adjoint and hPðuÞ; ui > 0 for every u 6¼ 0 in V.

The corresponding theorem for positive operators (proved in Problem 13.21) follows.
THEOREM 13.10B:

The following conditions on an operator P are equivalent:
(i) P ¼ T 2 for some self-adjoint operator T.
(ii) P is positive; that is, P ¼ S  S:
(iii) P is self-adjoint and hPðuÞ; ui  0 for every u 2 V.

13.9

Diagonalization and Canonical Forms in Inner Product Spaces

Let T be a linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V over K. Representing T by a
diagonal matrix depends upon the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of T, and hence, upon the roots of
the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T. Now DðtÞ always factors into linear polynomials over the
complex ﬁeld C but may not have any linear polynomials over the real ﬁeld R. Thus, the situation
for real inner product spaces (sometimes called Euclidean spaces) is inherently different than the
situation for complex inner product spaces (sometimes called unitary spaces). Thus, we treat them
separately.

Real Inner Product Spaces, Symmetric and Orthogonal Operators
The following theorem (proved in Problem 13.14) holds.
THEOREM 13.11:

Let T be a symmetric (self-adjoint) operator on a real ﬁnite-dimensional product
space V. Then there exists an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of
T ; that is, T can be represented by a diagonal matrix relative to an orthonormal
basis.

We give the corresponding statement for matrices.
THEOREM 13.11:

(Alternative Form) Let A be a real symmetric matrix. Then there exists an
orthogonal matrix P such that B ¼ P1AP ¼ PTAP is diagonal.

We can choose the columns of the above matrix P to be normalized orthogonal eigenvectors of A; then
the diagonal entries of B are the corresponding eigenvalues.
On the other hand, an orthogonal operator T need not be symmetric, and so it may not be represented
by a diagonal matrix relative to an orthonormal matrix. However, such a matrix T does have a simple
canonical representation, as described in the following theorem (proved in Problem 13.16).

CHAPTER 13 Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces
THEOREM 13.12:

383

Let T be an orthogonal operator on a real inner product space V. Then there exists
an orthonormal basis of V in which T is represented by a block diagonal matrix M
of the form

cos y1  sin y1
cos yr  sin yr
M ¼ diag Is ; It ;

The reader may recognize that each of the 2 2 diagonal blocks represents a rotation in the
corresponding two-dimensional subspace, and each diagonal entry 1 represents a reﬂection in the
corresponding one-dimensional subspace.

Complex Inner Product Spaces, Normal and Triangular Operators
A linear operator T is said to be normal if it commutes with its adjoint—that is, if TT * ¼ T *T. We note
that normal operators include both self-adjoint and unitary operators.
Analogously, a complex matrix A is said to be normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose—
that is, if AA* ¼ A*A.

The following theorem (proved in Problem 13.19) holds.
THEOREM 13.13:

Let T be a normal operator on a complex ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V.
Then there exists an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T ; that
is, T can be represented by a diagonal matrix relative to an orthonormal basis.

We give the corresponding statement for matrices.
THEOREM 13.13:

(Alternative Form) Let A be a normal matrix. Then there exists a unitary matrix
P such that B ¼ P1 AP ¼ P*AP is diagonal.

The following theorem (proved in Problem 13.20) shows that even nonnormal operators on unitary
spaces have a relatively simple form.
THEOREM 13.14:

Let T be an arbitrary operator on a complex ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space
V. Then T can be represented by a triangular matrix relative to an orthonormal
basis of V.

THEOREM 13.14:

(Alternative Form) Let A be an arbitrary complex matrix. Then there exists a
unitary matrix P such that B ¼ P1 AP ¼ P*AP is triangular.

13.10

Spectral Theorem

The Spectral Theorem is a reformulation of the diagonalization Theorems 13.11 and 13.13.
THEOREM 13.15:

(Spectral Theorem) Let T be a normal (symmetric) operator on a complex (real)
ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V. Then there exists linear operators
E1 ; . . . ; Er on V and scalars l1 ; . . . ; lr such that
(i) T ¼ l1 E1 þ l2 E2 þ    þ lr Er ,
(ii) E1 þ E2 þ    þ Er ¼ I,

(iii) E12 ¼ E1 ; E22 ¼ E2 ; . . . ; Er2 ¼ Er ,
(iv) Ei Ej ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j.

CHAPTER 13

Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces

The above linear operators E1 ; . . . ; Er are projections in the sense that Ei2 ¼ Ei . Moreover, they are
said to be orthogonal projections because they have the additional property that Ei Ej ¼ 0 for i 6¼ j.
The following example shows the relationship between a diagonal matrix representation and the
corresponding orthogonal projections.

Because u^ and f agree on each basis vector, u^ ¼ f.
Now suppose u0 is another vector in V for which fðvÞ ¼ hv; u0 i for every v 2 V. Then hv; ui ¼ hv; u0 i
or hv; u  u0 i ¼ 0. In particular, this is true for v ¼ u  u0 , and so hu  u0 ; u  u0 i ¼ 0. This yields
u  u0 ¼ 0 and u ¼ u0 . Thus, such a vector u is unique, as claimed.

Prove Theorem 13.1: Let T be a linear operator on an n-dimensional inner product space V . Then
(a) There exists a unique linear operator T * on V such that
hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; T *ðvÞi for all u; v 2 V :

(b) Let A be the matrix that represents T relative to an orthonormal basis S ¼ fui g. Then the
conjugate transpose A* of A represents T * in the basis S.
(a)

We ﬁrst deﬁne the mapping T *. Let v be an arbitrary but ﬁxed element of V. The map u 7! hT ðuÞ; vi
is a linear functional on V. Hence, by Theorem 13.3, there exists a unique element v 0 2 V such
that hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; v 0 i for every u 2 V. We deﬁne T * : V ! V by T *ðvÞ ¼ v 0 . Then
hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; T *ðvÞi for every u; v 2 V.
We next show that T * is linear. For any u; v i 2 V, and any a; b 2 K,
 ðuÞ; v 2 i
hu; T *ðav 1 þ bv 2 Þi ¼ hT ðuÞ; av 1 þ bv 2 i ¼ ahT ðuÞ; v 1 i þ bhT
 T *ðv 2 Þi ¼ hu; aT *ðv 1 Þ þ bT *ðv 2 Þi
¼ ahu; T *ðv 1 Þi þ bhu;

But this is true for every u 2 V ; hence, T *ðav 1 þ bv 2 Þ ¼ aT *ðv 1 Þ þ bT *ðv 2 Þ. Thus, T * is linear.
(b) The matrices A ¼ ½aij  and B ¼ ½bij  that represent T and T *, respectively, relative to the orthonormal
basis S are given by aij ¼ hT ðuj Þ; ui i and bij ¼ hT *ðuj Þ; ui i (Problem 13.67). Hence,
bij ¼ hT *ðuj Þ; ui i ¼ hui ; T *ðuj Þi ¼ hT ðui Þ; uj i ¼ aji
Thus, B ¼ A*, as claimed.

Show that ðaÞ I* ¼ I, and ðbÞ 0* ¼ 0.
(a) For every u; v 2 V, hIðuÞ; vi ¼ hu; vi ¼ hu; IðvÞi; hence, I* ¼ I.
(b) For every u; v 2 V, h0ðuÞ; vi ¼ h0; vi ¼ 0 ¼ hu; 0i ¼ hu; 0ðvÞi; hence, 0* ¼ 0.

Suppose T is invertible. Show that ðT 1 Þ* ¼ ðT *Þ1 .
I ¼ I* ¼ ðTT 1 Þ* ¼ ðT 1 Þ*T *; hence; ðT 1 Þ* ¼ ðT *Þ1 :

13.8.

Let T be a linear operator on V, and let W be a T -invariant subspace of V. Show that W ? is
invariant under T *.
Let u 2 W ? . If w 2 W, then T ðwÞ 2 W and so hw; T *ðuÞi ¼ hT ðwÞ; ui ¼ 0. Thus, T *ðuÞ 2 W ?
because it is orthogonal to every w 2 W. Hence, W ? is invariant under T *.

13.9.

Let T be a linear operator on V. Show that each of the following conditions implies T ¼ 0:
(i) hT ðuÞ; vi ¼ 0 for every u; v 2 V .
(ii) V is a complex space, and hT ðuÞ; ui ¼ 0 for every u 2 V .
(iii) T is self-adjoint and hT ðuÞ; ui ¼ 0 for every u 2 V.
Give an example of an operator T on a real space V for which hT ðuÞ; ui ¼ 0 for every u 2 V but T 6¼ 0.
[Thus, (ii) need not hold for a real space V.]
(i) Set v ¼ T ðuÞ. Then hT ðuÞ; T ðuÞi ¼ 0, and hence, T ðuÞ ¼ 0, for every u 2 V. Accordingly, T ¼ 0.
(ii) By hypothesis, hT ðv þ wÞ; v þ wi ¼ 0 for any v; w 2 V. Expanding and setting hT ðvÞ; vi ¼ 0 and
hT ðwÞ; wi ¼ 0, we ﬁnd
ð1Þ
hT ðvÞ; wi þ hT ðwÞ; vi ¼ 0
 ðvÞ; wi ¼ ihT ðvÞ; wi and
Note w is arbitrary in (1). Substituting iw for w, and using hT ðvÞ; iwi ¼ ihT
hT ðiwÞ; vi ¼ hiT ðwÞ; vi ¼ ihT ðwÞ; vi, we ﬁnd
ihT ðvÞ; wi þ ihT ðwÞ; vi ¼ 0
(iii)

Dividing through by i and adding to (1), we obtain hT ðwÞ; vi ¼ 0 for any v; w; 2 V. By (i), T ¼ 0.
By (ii), the result holds for the complex case; hence we need only consider the real case. Expanding
hT ðv þ wÞ; v þ wi ¼ 0, we again obtain (1). Because T is self-adjoint and as it is a real space, we
have hT ðwÞ; vi ¼ hw; T ðvÞi ¼ hT ðvÞ; wi. Substituting this into (1), we obtain hT ðvÞ; wi ¼ 0 for any
v; w 2 V. By (i), T ¼ 0.
For an example, consider the linear operator T on R2 deﬁned by T ðx; yÞ ¼ ðy; xÞ. Then
hT ðuÞ; ui ¼ 0 for every u 2 V, but T 6¼ 0.

Orthogonal and Unitary Operators and Matrices
13.10. Prove Theorem 13.6: The following conditions on an operator U are equivalent:
(i) U * ¼ U 1 ; that is, U is unitary. (ii) hU ðvÞ; U ðwÞi ¼ hu; wi.
Suppose (i) holds. Then, for every v; w; 2 V,

(iii) kU ðvÞk ¼ kvk.

hU ðvÞ; U ðwÞi ¼ hv; U *U ðwÞi ¼ hv; IðwÞi ¼ hv; wi
Thus, (i) implies (ii). Now if (ii) holds, then
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kU ðvÞk ¼ hU ðvÞ; U ðvÞi ¼ hv; vi ¼ kvk
Hence, (ii) implies (iii). It remains to show that (iii) implies (i).
Suppose (iii) holds. Then for every v 2 V,
hU *U ðvÞi ¼ hU ðvÞ; U ðvÞi ¼ hv; vi ¼ hIðvÞ; vi
Hence, hðU *U  IÞðvÞ; vi ¼ 0 for every v 2 V. But U *U  I is self-adjoint (Prove!); then, by Problem
13.9, we have U *U  I ¼ 0 and so U *U ¼ I. Thus, U * ¼ U 1 , as claimed.

13.11. Let U be a unitary (orthogonal) operator on V, and let W be a subspace invariant under U . Show
that W ? is also invariant under U .
Because U is nonsingular, U ðW Þ ¼ W ; that is, for any w 2 W, there exists w0 2 W such that
U ðw Þ ¼ w. Now let v 2 W ? . Then, for any w 2 W,
0

hU ðvÞ; wi ¼ hU ðvÞ; U ðw0 Þi ¼ hv; w0 i ¼ 0
Thus, U ðvÞ belongs to W ? . Therefore, W ? is invariant under U .

13.12. Prove Theorem 13.9: The change-of-basis matrix from an orthonormal basis fu1 ; . . . ; un g into
another orthonormal basis is unitary P
(orthogonal). Conversely, if P ¼ ½aij  is a unitary (orthogonal) matrix, then the vectors ui0 ¼ j aji uj form an orthonormal basis.
Suppose fv i g is another orthonormal basis and suppose
v i ¼ bi1 u1 þ bi2 u2 þ    þ bin un ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; n

ð1Þ

Because fv i g is orthonormal,
dij ¼ hv i ; v j i ¼ bi1 bj1 þ bi2 bj2 þ    þ bin bjn

ð2Þ

Let B ¼ ½bij  be the matrix of coefﬁcients in (1). (Then BT is the change-of-basis matrix from fui g to
fv i g.) Then BB* ¼ ½cij , where cij ¼ bi1 bj1 þ bi2 bj2 þ    þ bin bjn . By (2), cij ¼ dij , and therefore BB* ¼ I.
Accordingly, B, and hence, BT, is unitary.
It remains to prove that fu0i g is orthonormal. By Problem 13.67,
hu0i ; u0j i ¼ a1i a1j þ a2i a2j þ    þ ani anj ¼ hCi ; Cj i
where Ci denotes the ith column of the unitary (orthogonal) matrix P ¼ ½aij : Because P is unitary
(orthogonal), its columns are orthonormal; hence, hu0i ; u0j i ¼ hCi ; Cj i ¼ dij . Thus, fu0i g is an orthonormal basis.

Symmetric Operators and Canonical Forms in Euclidean Spaces
13.13. Let T be a symmetric operator. Show that (a) The characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T is a
product of linear polynomials (over R); (b) T has a nonzero eigenvector.
(a) Let A be a matrix representing T relative to an orthonormal basis of V ; then A ¼ AT. Let DðtÞ be the
characteristic polynomial of A. Viewing A as a complex self-adjoint operator, A has only real
eigenvalues by Theorem 13.4. Thus,
DðtÞ ¼ ðt  l1 Þðt  l2 Þ    ðt  ln Þ
where the li are all real. In other words, DðtÞ is a product of linear polynomials over R.
(b) By (a), T has at least one (real) eigenvalue. Hence, T has a nonzero eigenvector.

13.14. Prove Theorem 13.11: Let T be a symmetric operator on a real n-dimensional inner product
space V. Then there exists an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T. (Hence, T
can be represented by a diagonal matrix relative to an orthonormal basis.)
The proof is by induction on the dimension of V. If dim V ¼ 1, the theorem trivially holds. Now
suppose dim V ¼ n > 1. By Problem 13.13, there exists a nonzero eigenvector v 1 of T. Let W be the space
spanned by v 1 , and let u1 be a unit vector in W, e.g., let u1 ¼ v 1 =kv 1 k.
Because v 1 is an eigenvector of T, the subspace W of V is invariant under T. By Problem 13.8, W ? is
invariant under T * ¼ T. Thus, the restriction T^ of T to W ? is a symmetric operator. By Theorem 7.4,
V ¼ W W ? . Hence, dim W ? ¼ n  1, because dim W ¼ 1. By induction, there exists an orthonormal
basis fu2 ; . . . ; un g of W ? consisting of eigenvectors of T^ and hence of T. But hu1 ; ui i ¼ 0 for i ¼ 2; . . . ; n
because ui 2 W ? . Accordingly fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is an orthonormal set and consists of eigenvectors of T.
Thus, the theorem is proved.

13.16. Prove Theorem 13.12: Let T be an orthogonal operator on a real inner product space V. Then
there exists an orthonormal basis of V in which T is represented by a block diagonal matrix M of

Let S ¼ T þ T 1 ¼ T þ T *. Then S* ¼ ðT þ T *Þ* ¼ T * þ T ¼ S. Thus, S is a symmetric operator
on V. By Theorem 13.11, there exists an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of S. If
l1 ; . . . ; lm denote the distinct eigenvalues of S, then V can be decomposed into the direct sum
V ¼ V1 V2    Vm where the Vi consists of the eigenvectors of S belonging to li . We claim that
each Vi is invariant under T. For suppose v 2 V ; then SðvÞ ¼ li v and
SðT ðvÞÞ ¼ ðT þ T 1 ÞT ðvÞ ¼ T ðT þ T 1 ÞðvÞ ¼ TSðvÞ ¼ T ðli vÞ ¼ li T ðvÞ
That is, T ðvÞ 2 Vi . Hence, Vi is invariant under T. Because the Vi are orthogonal to each other, we can
restrict our investigation to the way that T acts on each individual Vi .
On a given Vi ; we have ðT þ T 1 Þv ¼ SðvÞ ¼ li v. Multiplying by T, we get
ðT 2  li T þ IÞðvÞ ¼ 0

ð1Þ

389

CHAPTER 13 Linear Operators on Inner Product Spaces

We consider the cases li ¼ 2 and li 6¼ 2 separately. If li ¼ 2, then ðT IÞ2 ðvÞ ¼ 0, which leads to
ðT IÞðvÞ ¼ 0 or T ðvÞ ¼ v. Thus, T restricted to this Vi is either I or I.
If li 6¼ 2, then T has no eigenvectors in Vi , because, by Theorem 13.4, the only eigenvalues of T are
1 or 1. Accordingly, for v 6¼ 0, the vectors v and T ðvÞ are linearly independent. Let W be the subspace
spanned by v and T ðvÞ. Then W is invariant under T, because using (1) we get
T ðT ðvÞÞ ¼ T 2 ðvÞ ¼ li T ðvÞ  v 2 W
By Theorem 7.4, Vi ¼ W W ? . Furthermore, by Problem 13.8, W ? is also invariant under T. Thus, we
can decompose Vi into the direct sum of two-dimensional subspaces Wj where the Wj are orthogonal to
each other and each Wj is invariant under T. Thus, we can restrict our investigation to the way in which T
acts on each individual Wj .
Because T 2  li T þ I ¼ 0, the characteristic polynomial DðtÞ of T acting on Wj is
DðtÞ ¼ t2  li t þ 1. Thus, the determinant of T is 1, the constant term in DðtÞ. By Theorem 2.7, the
matrix A representing T acting on Wj relative to any orthogonal basis of Wj must be of the form


cos y  sin y
sin y
cos y
The union of the bases of the Wj gives an orthonormal basis of Vi , and the union of the bases of the Vi gives
an orthonormal basis of V in which the matrix representing T is of the desired form.

(a) T ðvÞ ¼ 0 if and only if T *ðvÞ ¼ 0. (b)

T  lI is normal.

(c) If TðvÞ ¼ lv, then T *ðvÞ ¼ lv; hence, any eigenvector of T is also an eigenvector of T *.
(d) If T ðvÞ ¼ l1 v and T ðwÞ ¼ l2 w where l1 6¼ l2 , then hv; wi ¼ 0; that is, eigenvectors of T
belonging to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.
(a) We show that hT ðvÞ; T ðvÞi ¼ hT *ðvÞ; T *ðvÞi:
hT ðvÞ; T ðvÞi ¼ hv; T *T ðvÞi ¼ hv; TT *ðvÞi ¼ hT *ðvÞ; T *ðvÞi
Hence, by ½I3  in the deﬁnition of the inner product in Section 7.2, T ðvÞ ¼ 0 if and only if T *ðvÞ ¼ 0.
(b) We show that T  lI commutes with its adjoint:

(c) If T ðvÞ ¼ lv, then ðT  lIÞðvÞ ¼ 0. Now T  lI is normal by (b); therefore, by (a),
ðT  lIÞ*ðvÞ ¼ 0. That is, ðT *  lIÞðvÞ ¼ 0; hence, T *ðvÞ ¼ 

But l1 6¼ l2 ; hence, hv; wi ¼ 0.

13.19. Prove Theorem 13.13: Let T be a normal operator on a complex ﬁnite-dimensional inner product
space V. Then there exists an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T. (Thus, T
can be represented by a diagonal matrix relative to an orthonormal basis.)
The proof is by induction on the dimension of V. If dim V ¼ 1, then the theorem trivially holds. Now
suppose dim V ¼ n > 1. Because V is a complex vector space, T has at least one eigenvalue and hence a
nonzero eigenvector v. Let W be the subspace of V spanned by v, and let u1 be a unit vector in W.
Because v is an eigenvector of T, the subspace W is invariant under T. However, v is also an
eigenvector of T * by Problem 13.18; hence, W is also invariant under T *. By Problem 13.8, W ? is
invariant under T ** ¼ T. The remainder of the proof is identical with the latter part of the proof of
Theorem 13.11 (Problem 13.14).

13.20. Prove Theorem 13.14: Let T be any operator on a complex ﬁnite-dimensional inner product
space V. Then T can be represented by a triangular matrix relative to an orthonormal basis of V.
The proof is by induction on the dimension of V. If dim V ¼ 1, then the theorem trivially holds. Now
suppose dim V ¼ n > 1. Because V is a complex vector space, T has at least one eigenvalue and hence at
least one nonzero eigenvector v. Let W be the subspace of V spanned by v, and let u1 be a unit vector in W.
Then u1 is an eigenvector of T and, say, T ðu1 Þ ¼ a11 u1 .
By Theorem 7.4, V ¼ W W ? . Let E denote the orthogonal projection V into W ? . Clearly W ? is
invariant under the operator ET. By induction, there exists an orthonormal basis fu2 ; . . . ; un g of W ? such
that, for i ¼ 2; . . . ; n,
ET ðui Þ ¼ ai2 u2 þi3 u3 þ    þ aii ui
(Note that fu1 ; u2 ; . . . ; un g is an orthonormal basis of V.) But E is the orthogonal projection of V onto W ? ;
hence, we must have
T ðui Þ ¼ ai1 u1 þ ai2 u2 þ    þ aii ui
for i ¼ 2; . . . ; n. This with T ðu1 Þ ¼ a11 u1 gives us the desired result.

Miscellaneous Problems
13.21. Prove Theorem 13.10B: The following are equivalent:
(i) P ¼ T 2 for some self-adjoint operator T.
(ii) P ¼ S*S for some operator S; that is, P is positive.
(iii) P is self-adjoint and hPðuÞ; ui  0 for every u 2 V.
Suppose (i) holds; that is, P ¼ T 2 where T ¼ T *. Then P ¼ TT ¼ T *T, and so (i) implies (ii). Now
suppose (ii) holds. Then P* ¼ ðS*SÞ* ¼ S*S** ¼ S*S ¼ P, and so P is self-adjoint. Furthermore,
hPðuÞ; ui ¼ hS*SðuÞ; ui ¼ hSðuÞ; SðuÞi  0
Thus, (ii) implies (iii), and so it remains to prove that (iii) implies (i).
Now suppose (iii) holds. Because P is self-adjoint, there exists an orthonormal basis fu1 ; . . . ; un g of V
consisting of eigenvectors of P; say, Pðui Þ ¼ li ui . By Theorem 13.4, the li are real. Using (iii), we show
that the li are nonnegative. We have, for each i,
0  hPðui Þ; ui i ¼ hli ui ; ui i ¼ li hui ; ui i
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Thus, hui ; ui i  0 forces li  0; as claimed. Accordingly, li is a real number. Let T be the linear
operator deﬁned by
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T ðui Þ ¼ li ui for i ¼ 1; . . . ; n

Because T is represented by a real diagonal matrix relative to the orthonormal basis fui g, T is self-adjoint.
Moreover, for each i,
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ

pﬃﬃﬃﬃpﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T 2 ðui Þ ¼ T ð li ui Þ ¼ li T ðii Þ ¼ li li ui ¼ li ui ¼ Pðui Þ
Because T 2 and P agree on a basis of V ; P ¼ T 2 . Thus, the theorem is proved.
Remark: The above operator T is the unique positive operator such that P ¼ T 2 ; it is called the
positive square root of P.

13.22. Show that any operator T is the sum of a self-adjoint operator and a skew-adjoint operator.
Set S ¼ 12 ðT þ T *Þ and U ¼ 12 ðT  T *Þ: Then T ¼ S þ U; where

and

S* ¼ ½12 ðT þ T *Þ* ¼ 12 ðT * þ T **Þ ¼ 12 ðT * þ T Þ ¼ S
U * ¼ ½12 ðT  T *Þ* ¼ 12 ðT *  T Þ ¼  12 ðT  T *Þ ¼ U

that is, S is self-adjoint and U is skew-adjoint.

13.23. Prove: Let T be an arbitrary linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional inner product space V. Then
T is a product of a unitary (orthogonal) operator U and a unique positive operator P; that is,
T ¼ UP. Furthermore, if T is invertible, then U is also uniquely determined.
By Theorem 13.10, T *T is a positive operator; hence, there exists a (unique) positive operator P such
that P2 ¼ T *T (Problem 13.43). Observe that
kPðvÞk2 ¼ hPðvÞ; PðvÞi ¼ hP2 ðvÞ; vi ¼ hT *T ðvÞ; vi ¼ hT ðvÞ; T ðvÞi ¼ kT ðvÞk2

ð1Þ

We now consider separately the cases when T is invertible and noninvertible.
If T is invertible, then we set U^ ¼ PT 1 . We show that U^ is unitary:
^ * ¼ ðPT 1 Þ* ¼ T 1 P* ¼ ðT *Þ1 P
U

and

^ U
^ ¼ ðT *Þ1 PPT 1 ¼ ðT *Þ1 T *TT 1 ¼ I
U

Thus, U^ is unitary. We next set U ¼ U^ 1 . Then U is also unitary, and T ¼ UP as required.
To prove uniqueness, we assume T ¼ U0 P0 , where U0 is unitary and P0 is positive. Then
2
T *T ¼ P*U
0 *U
0 0 P0 ¼ P0 IP0 ¼ P0

But the positive square root of T *T is unique (Problem 13.43); hence, P0 ¼ P. (Note that the invertibility
of T is not used to prove the uniqueness of P.) Now if T is invertible, then P is also invertible by (1).
Multiplying U0 P ¼ UP on the right by P1 yields U0 ¼ U . Thus, U is also unique when T is invertible.
Now suppose T is not invertible. Let W be the image of P; that is, W ¼ Im P. We deﬁne U1 :W ! V by
U1 ðwÞ ¼ T ðvÞ;

where

PðvÞ ¼ w

ð2Þ

We must show that U1 is well deﬁned; that is, that PðvÞ ¼ Pðv 0 Þ implies T ðvÞ ¼ T ðv 0 Þ. This follows from
the fact that Pðv  v 0 Þ ¼ 0 is equivalent to kPðv  v 0 Þk ¼ 0, which forces kT ðv  v 0 Þk ¼ 0 by (1). Thus,
U1 is well deﬁned. We next deﬁne U2 :W ! V. Note that, by (1), P and T have the same kernels. Hence, the
images of P and T have the same dimension; that is, dimðIm PÞ ¼ dim W ¼ dimðIm T Þ. Consequently,
W ? and ðIm T Þ? also have the same dimension. We let U2 be any isomorphism between W ? and ðIm T Þ? .
We next set U ¼ U1 U2 . [Here U is deﬁned as follows: If v 2 V and v ¼ w þ w0 , where w 2 W,
0
w 2 W ? , then U ðvÞ ¼ U1 ðwÞ þ U2 ðw0 Þ.] Now U is linear (Problem 13.69), and, if v 2 V and PðvÞ ¼ w,
then, by (2),
T ðvÞ ¼ U1 ðwÞ ¼ U ðwÞ ¼ UPðvÞ
Thus, T ¼ UP, as required.
It remains to show that U is unitary. Now every vector x 2 V can be written in the form x ¼ PðvÞ þ w0 ,
where w0 2 W ? . Then U ðxÞ ¼ UPðvÞ þ U2 ðw0 Þ ¼ T ðvÞ þ U2 ðw0 Þ, where hT ðvÞ; U2 ðw0 Þi ¼ 0 by deﬁnition

Give an example of a linear functional f on V for which Theorem 13.3 does not hold—that is,
for which there is no polynomial hðtÞ such that fð f Þ ¼ h f ; hi for every f 2 V.
Let f:V ! R be deﬁned by fð f Þ ¼ f ð0Þ; that is, f evaluates f ðtÞ at 0, and hence maps f ðtÞ into its
constant term. Suppose a polynomial hðtÞ exists for which
ð1
fðf Þ ¼ f ð0Þ ¼ f ðtÞhðtÞ dt
ð1Þ
0

for every polynomial f ðtÞ. Observe that f maps the polynomial tf ðtÞ into 0; hence, by (1),
ð1
tf ðtÞhðtÞ dt ¼ 0

ð2Þ

0

for every polynomial f ðtÞ. In particular (2) must hold for f ðtÞ ¼ thðtÞ; that is,
ð1
t2 h2 ðtÞ dt ¼ 0
0

This integral forces hðtÞ to be the zero polynomial; hence, fð f Þ ¼ h f ; hi ¼ h f ; 0i ¼ 0 for every
polynomial f ðtÞ. This contradicts the fact that f is not the zero functional; hence, the polynomial hðtÞ
does not exist.

Multilinear Products
A.1

Introduction

The material in this appendix is much more abstract than that which has previously appeared. Accordingly,
many of the proofs will be omitted. Also, we motivate the material with the following observation.
Let S be a basis of a vector space V. Theorem 5.2 may be restated as follows.
THEOREM 5.2:

Let g : S ! V be the inclusion map of the basis S into V. Then, for any vector space
U and any mapping f : S ! U ; there exists a unique linear mapping f  : V ! U such
that f ¼ f   g:

Another way to state the fact that f ¼ f   g is that the diagram in Fig. A-1(a) commutes.

Figure A-1

A.2

Bilinear Mapping and Tensor Products

Let U, V, W be vector spaces over a ﬁeld K. Consider a map
f:V

W !U

Then f is said to be bilinear if, for each v 2 V ; the map fv : W ! U deﬁned by fv ðwÞ ¼ f ðv; wÞ is linear;
and, for each w 2 W ; the map fw : V ! U deﬁned by fw ðv Þ ¼ f ðv; wÞ is linear.
That is, f is linear in each of its two variables. Note that f is similar to a bilinear form except that the
values of the map f are in a vector space U rather than the ﬁeld K.
DEFINITION A.1:

Let V and W be vector spaces over the same ﬁeld K. The tensor product of V and
W is a vector space T over K together with a bilinear map g : V W ! T ;
denoted by g ðv; wÞ ¼ v  w; with the following property: (*) For any vector
space U over K and any bilinear map f : V W ! U there exists a unique linear
map f  : T ! U such that f   g ¼ f :

The tensor product (T, g) [or simply T when g is understood] of V and W is denoted by V  W ; and the
element v  w is called the tensor of v and w.
Another way to state condition (*) is that the diagram in Fig. A-1(b) commutes. The fact that such
a unique linear map f* exists is called the ‘‘Universal Mapping Principle’’ (UMP). As illustrated in
Fig. A-1(b), condition (*) also says that any bilinear map f : V W ! U ‘‘factors through’’ the tensor
product T ¼ V  W : The uniqueness in (*) implies that the image of g spans T; that is, span ðfv  wgÞ ¼ T :

Appendix A Multilinear Products

(Uniqueness of Tensor Products) Let (T, g) and ðT 0 ; g 0 Þ be tensor products of V
and W. Then there exists a unique isomorphism h : T ! T 0 such that hg ¼ g0 :

THEOREM A.1:

Proof. Because T is a tensor product, and g 0 : V  W ! T 0 is bilinear, there exists a unique linear map
h : T ! T 0 such that hg ¼ g 0 : Similarly, because T 0 is a tensor product, and g : V  W ! T 0 is bilinear,
there exists a unique linear map h0 : T 0 ! T such that h0 g0 ¼ g: Using hg ¼ g 0 , we get h0 hg ¼ g: Also,
because T is a tensor product, and g : V  W ! T is bilinear, there exists a unique linear map h : T ! T
such that h g ¼ g: But 1T g ¼ g: Thus, h0 h ¼ h ¼ 1T . Similarly, hh0 ¼ 1T0 : Therefore, h is an
isomorphism from T to T 0 :
(Existence of Tensor Product) The tensor product T ¼ V  W of vector spaces V
and W over K exists. Let fv 1 ; . . . ; v m g be a basis of V and let fw1 ; . . . ; wn g be a
basis of W. Then the mn vectors

THEOREM A.2:

ði ¼ 1; . . . ; m; j ¼ 1; . . . ; nÞ

v i  wi

form a basis of T. Thus, dim T ¼ mn ¼ ðdim V Þðdim W Þ:


Outline of Proof. Suppose
v 1; . . . ; v m is a basis of

 V, and suppose fw1 ; . . . ; wn g is a basis of W.
Consider the mn symbols tij ji ¼ i; . . . ; m; j ¼ 1; . . . ; n . Let T be the vector space generated by the tij .
That is, T consists of all linear combinations of the tij with coefﬁcients in K. [See Problem 4.137.]
Let v 2 V and w 2 W . Say
v ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ    þ am v m

and w ¼ b1 w1 þ b2 w2 þ    þ bm wm

Let g : V

Then g is bilinear. [Proof left to reader.]
Now let f : V W ! U be bilinear. Because the tij form a basis of T, Theorem 5.2 (stated above)

Therefore, f ¼ f  g where f * is the required map in Deﬁnition A.1. Thus, T is a tensor product.
Let fv 01 ; . . . ; v 0m g be any basis of V and fw01 ; . . . ; w0m g be any basis of W.
Let v 2 V and w 2 W and say
v ¼ a01 v 01 þ    þ a0m v 0m
Then

Thus, the elements
v 0i  w0j span T. There are mn such elements. They cannot be linearly dependent

because tij is a basis of T, and hence, dim T ¼ mn. Thus, the v 0i  w0j form a basis of T.
Next we give two concrete examples of tensor products.
EXAMPLE A.1 Let V be the vector space of polynomials Pr1 ð xÞ and let W be the vector space of polynomials
Ps1 ð yÞ. Thus, the following from bases of V and W, respectively,

1; x; x2 ; . . . ; xr1

and

Isomorphisms of Tensor Products
First we note that tensoring is associative in a cannonical way. Namely,
THEOREM A.3:

Let U, V, W be vector spaces over a ﬁeld K. Then there exists a unique isomorphism
ðU  V Þ  W ! U  ðV  W Þ
such that, for every u 2 U ; v 2 V ; w 2 W ;
ðu  v Þ  w 7! u  ðv  wÞ

Accordingly, we may omit parenthesis when tensoring any number of factors. Speciﬁcally, given
vectors spaces V1 ; V2 ; . . . ; Vm over a ﬁeld K, we may unambiguously form their tensor product
V1  V2  . . .  Vm
and, for vectors v j in Vj , we may unambiguously form the tensor product
v1  v2  . . .  vm
Moreover, given a vector space V over K, we may unambiguously deﬁne the following tensor
product:
r V ¼ V  V  . . .  V ðr factorsÞ
Also, there is a canonical isomorphism
ðr V Þ  ðs V Þ ! rþs V
Furthermore, viewing K as a vector space over itself, we have the canonical isomorphism
KV !V
where we deﬁne a  v ¼ av:

Alternating Multilinear Maps

Let f : V r ! U where V and U are vector spaces over K. [Recall V r ¼ V

V

...

V , r factors.]

(1) The mapping f is said to be multilinear or r-linear if f ðv 1 ; . . . ; v r Þ is linear as a function of each v j
when the other v i’s are held ﬁxed. That is,
f ð. . . ; v j þ v 0j ; . . .Þ ¼ f ð. . . ; v j ; . . .Þ þ f ð. . . ; v 0j ; . . .Þ
f ð. . . ; kv j ; . . .Þ ¼ kf ð. . . ; v j ; . . .Þ
where only the jth position changes.
(2) The mapping f is said to be alternating if
f ðv 1 ; . . . ; v r Þ ¼ 0 whenever v i ¼ v j with i 6¼ j
One can easily show (Prove!) that if f is an alternating multilinear mapping on Vr, then
f . . . ; v i ; . . . ; v j ; . . . ¼ f . . . ; v j ; . . . ; v i ; . . .
That is, if two of the vectors are interchanged, then the associated value changes sign.
EXAMPLE A.3 (Determinants)
The determinant function D : M ! K on the space M of n

n matrices may be viewed as an n-variable function

Dð AÞ ¼ DðR1 ; R2 ; . . . ; Rn Þ
deﬁned on the rows R1 ; R2 ; . . . ; Rn of A. Recall (Chapter 8) that, in this context, D is both n-linear and alternating.

We now need some additional notation. Let K ¼ ½k1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kr  denote an r-list (r-tuple) of elements
from In ¼ ð1; 2; . . . ; nÞ. We will then use the following notation where the v k ’s denote vectors and the
aik’s denote scalars:
v K ¼ ðv k1 ; v k2 ; . . . ; v kr Þ and aK ¼ a1k1 a2k2 . . . arkr
Note v K is a list of r vectors, and aK is a product of r scalars.
Now suppose the elements in K ¼ ½k1 ; k2 ; . . . ; kr  are distinct. Then K is a permutation sK of an r-list
J ¼ ½i1 ; i2 ; . . . ; ir  in standard form, that is, where i1 < i2 < . . . < ir . The number of such standard-form

LEMMA A.4

Let V and U be vector spaces over K, and let f : V r ! U be an alternating r-linear
mapping. Let v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v n be vectors in V and let A ¼ aij be an r n matrix over K

where the sum is over all r-lists K from f1; . . . ; ng. The alternating property of f tells us that f ðv K Þ ¼ 0
when K does not contain distinct integers. The proof now mainly uses the fact that as we interchange the
v j’s to transform
f ðv K Þ ¼ f ðv k1 ; v k2 ; . . . ; v kr Þ

f v j ¼ f ðv i1 ; v i2 ; . . . ; v ir Þ

to

so that i1 <    < ir , the associated sign of aK , will change in the same way as the sign of the
corresponding permutation sK changes when it is transformed to the identity permutation using
transpositions.
We illustrate the lemma below for r ¼ 2 and n ¼ 3.
EXAMPLE A.4

Suppose f : V 2 ! U is an alternating multilinear function. Let v 1 ; v 2 ; v 3 2 V and let u; w 2 V .

Suppose

u ¼ a1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ a3 v 3 and w ¼ b1 v 1 þ b2 v 2 þ b3 v 3
Consider

f ðu; wÞ ¼ f ða1 v 1 þ a2 v 2 þ a3 v 3 ; b1 v 1 þ b2 v 2 þ b3 v 3 Þ
Using multilinearity, we get nine terms:

f ðu; wÞ ¼ a1 b1 f ðv 1 ; v r Þ þ a1 b2 f ðv 1 ; v 2 Þ þ a1 b3 f ðv 1 ; v 3 Þ
þ a2 b1 f ðv 2 ; v 1 Þ þ a2 b2 f ðv 2 ; v 2 Þ þ a2 b3 f ðv 2 ; v 3 Þ
þ a3 b1 f ðv 3 ; v 1 Þ þ a3 b2 f ðv 3 ; v 2 Þ þ a3 b3 f ðv 3 ; v 3 Þ
(Note that J ¼ ½1; 2; J 0 ¼ ½1; 3 and J 00 ¼ ½2; 3 are the three standard-form 2-lists of I ¼ ½1; 2; 3.) The
alternating property of f tells us that each f ðv i ; v i Þ ¼ 0; hence, three of the above nine terms are equal to
0. The alternating property also tells us that f v i ; v f ¼ f v f ; v r . Thus, three of the terms can be
transformed so their subscripts form a standard-form 2-list by a single interchange. Finally we obtain
f ðu; wÞ ¼ ða1 b2  a2 b1 Þ f ðv 1 ; v 2 Þ þ ða1 b3  a3 b1 Þ f ðv 1 ; v 3 Þ þ ða2 b3  a3 b2 Þ f ðv 2 ; v 3 Þ

Exterior Products

The following deﬁnition applies.
DEFINITION A.2:

Let V be an n-dimensionmal vector space over a ﬁeld K, and let r be an integer such
that 1  r  n. The r-fold exterior product (or simply exterior product when r is
understood) is a vector space E over K together with an alternating r-linear mapping
g : V r ! E, denoted by g ðv 1 ; . . . ; v r Þ ¼ v 1 ^ . . . ^ v r , with the following property:
(*) For any vector space U over K and any alternating r-linear map f : V r ! U
there exists a unique linear map f  : E ! U such that f   g ¼ f .

401

Appendix A Multilinear Products

The r-fold tensor product (E, g) (or simply E when g is understood) of V is denoted by ^r V , and the
element v 1 ^    ^ v r is called the exterior product or wedge product of the v i’s.
Another way to state condition (*) is that the diagram in Fig. A-1(c) commutes. Again, the fact that
such a unique linear map f * exists is called the ‘‘Universal Mapping Principle (UMP)’’. As illustrated in
Fig. A-1(c), condition (*) also says that any alternating r-linear map f : V r ! U ‘‘factors through’’ the
exterior product E ¼ ^r V . Again, the uniqueness in (*) implies that the image of g spans E; that is,
spanðv 1 ^    ^ v r Þ ¼ E.
THEOREM A.5:

(Uniqueness of Exterior Products) Let (E, g) and ðE0 ; g 0 Þ be r-fold exterior products
of V. Then there exists a unique isomorphism h : E ! E0 such that hg ¼ g 0 .

The proof is the same as the proof of Theorem A.1, which uses the UMP.
THEOREM A.6:

(Existence of Exterior Products) Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over K.
Then theexterior
product E ¼ ^r V exists. If r > n, then E ¼ f0g. If r  n, then

n
. Moreover, if ½v 1 ; . . . ; v n  is a basis of V, then the vectors
dim E ¼
r
v i1 ^ v i2 ^    ^ v ir ;

where 1  i1 < i2 <    < ir  n, form a basis of E.
We give a concrete example of an exterior product.
EXAMPLE A.5 (Cross Product)
2
Consider V ¼ R3 with the usual basis (i, j, k). Let E ¼ ^ V . Note dim V ¼ 3: Thus, dim E ¼ 3 with basis
3
i ^ j; i ^ k; j ^ k: We identify E with R under the correspondence

i ¼ j ^ k; j ¼ k ^ i ¼ i ^ k; k ¼ i ^ j
Let u and w be arbitrary vectors in V ¼ R3 , say
u ¼ ða1 ; a2 ; a3 Þ ¼ a1 i þ a2 j þ a3 k and w ¼ ðb1 ; b2 ; b3 Þ ¼ b1 i þ b2 j þ b3 k
Then, as in Example A.3,
u ^ w ¼ ða1 b2  a2 b1 Þði ^ jÞ þ ða1 b3  a3 b1 Þði ^ kÞ þ ða2 b3  a3 b2 Þðj ^ kÞ
Using the above identiﬁcation, we get
u ^ w ¼ ða2 b3  a3 b2 Þi  ða1 b3  a3 b1 Þj þ ða1 b2  a2 b1 Þk

The reader may recognize that the above exterior product is precisely the well-known cross product
in R3 .
Our last theorem tells us that we are actually able to ‘‘multiply’’ exterior products, which allows us to
form an ‘‘exterior algebra’’ that is illustrated below.
THEOREM A.7:

Let V be a vector space over K. Let r and s be positive integers. Then there is a
unique bilinear mapping

^r V ^s V ! ^rþs V
such that, for any vectors ui ; wj in V,
ðu1 ^    ^ ur Þ

ðw1 ^    ^ ws Þ 7! u1 ^    ^ ur ^ w1 ^    ^ ws

402

Appendix A Multilinear Products

EXAMPLE A.6

We form an exterior algebra A over a ﬁeld K using noncommuting variables x, y, z. Because it is an exterior algebra,
our variables satisfy:

x ^ x ¼ 0;

y ^ y ¼ 0;

z ^ z ¼ 0;

and y ^ x ¼ x ^ y;

z ^ x ¼ x ^ z;

z ^ y ¼ y ^ z

Every element of A is a linear combination of the eight elements

1;

x;

y;

z; x ^ y; x ^ z;

y ^ z; x ^ y ^ z

We multiply two ‘‘polynomials’’ in A using the usual distributive law, but now we also use the above conditions. For
example,

½3 þ 4y  5x ^ y þ 6x ^ z ^ ½5x  2y ¼ 15x  6y  20x ^ y þ 12x ^ y ^ z
Observe we use the fact that

½4y ^ ½5x ¼ 20y ^ x ¼ 20x ^ y and

½6x ^ z ^ ½2y ¼ 12x ^ z ^ y ¼ 12x ^ y ^ z

Algebraic Structures
B.1

Introduction

We deﬁne here algebraic structures that occur in almost all branches of mathematics. In particular, we
will deﬁne a ﬁeld that appears in the deﬁnition of a vector space. We begin with the deﬁnition of a group,
which is a relatively simple algebraic structure with only one operation and is used as a building block for
many other algebraic systems.

B.2

Groups

Let G be a nonempty set with a binary operation; that is, to each pair of elements a; b 2 G there is
assigned an element ab 2 G. Then G is called a group if the following axioms hold:
½G1  For any a; b; c 2 G, we have ðabÞc ¼ aðbcÞ (the associative law).
½G2  There exists an element e 2 G, called the identity element, such that ae ¼ ea ¼ a for every
a 2 G.
½G3  For each a 2 G there exists an element a1 2 G, called the inverse of a, such that
aa1 ¼ a1 a ¼ e.
A group G is said to be abelian (or: commutative) if the commutative law holds—that is, if ab ¼ ba for
every a; b 2 G.
When the binary operation is denoted by juxtaposition as above, the group G is said to be written
multiplicatively. Sometimes, when G is abelian, the binary operation is denoted by + and G is said to be
written additively. In such a case, the identity element is denoted by 0 and is called the zero element; the
inverse is denoted by a and it is called the negative of a.
If A and B are subsets of a group G, then we write
AB ¼ fabja 2 A; b 2 Bg or

A þ B ¼ fa þ bja 2 A; b 2 Bg

We also write a for {a}.
A subset H of a group G is called a subgroup of G if H forms a group under the operation of G. If H is
a subgroup of G and a 2 G, then the set Ha is called a right coset of H and the set aH is called a left coset
of H.
DEFINITION:

A subgroup H of G is called a normal subgroup if a1 Ha  H for every a 2 G.
Equivalently, H is normal if aH ¼ Ha for every a 2 G—that is, if the right and left
cosets of H coincide.

Note that every subgroup of an abelian group is normal.
THEOREM B.1:

Let H be a normal subgroup of G. Then the cosets of H in G form a group under
coset multiplication. This group is called the quotient group and is denoted by G/H.

403

404

Appendix B Algebraic Structures

EXAMPLE B.1 The set Z of integers forms an abelian group under addition. (We remark that the even integers
form a subgroup of Z but the odd integers do not.) Let H denote the set of multiples of 5; that is,
H ¼ f. . . ; 10; 5; 0; 5; 10; . . .g. Then H is a subgroup (necessarily normal) of Z. The cosets of H in Z follow:


0 ¼ 0 þ H ¼ H ¼ f. . . ; 10; 5; 0; 5; 10; . . .g
 ¼ 1 þ H ¼ f. . . ; 9; 4; 1; 6; 11; . . .g


2 ¼ 2 þ H ¼ f. . . ; 8; 3; 2; 7; 12; . . .g

3 ¼ 3 þ H ¼ f. . . ; 7; 2; 3; 8; 13; . . .g

4 ¼ 4 þ H ¼ f. . . ; 6; 1; 4; 9; 14; . . .g
For any other integer n 2 Z, n ¼ n þ H coincides with one of the above cosets. Thus, by the above theorem,
Z=H ¼ f0; 1; 
2; 
3; 
4g forms a group under coset addition; its addition table follows:

This quotient group Z/H is referred to as the integers modulo 5 and is frequently denoted by Z5 . Analogeusly, for
any positive integer n, there exists the quotient group Zn called the integers modulo n.
The permutations of n symbols (see page 267) form a group under composition of mappings; it is
called the symmetric group of degree n and is denoted by Sn . We investigate S3 here; its elements are

A mapping f from a group G into a group G0 is called a homomorphism if f ðabÞ ¼ f ðaÞf ðbÞ. For every
a; b 2 G. (If f is also bijective, i.e., one-to-one and onto, then f is called an isomorphism and G and G0 are

Appendix B Algebraic Structures

405

said to be isomorphic.) If f : G ! G0 is a homomorphism, then the kernel of f is the set of elements of G
that map into the identity element e0 2 G0 :
kernel of f ¼ fa 2 G j f ðaÞ ¼ e0 g
(As usual, f(G) is called the image of the mapping f : G ! G0 .) The following theorem applies.
THEOREM B.2:

Let f: G ! G be a homomorphism with kernel K. Then K is a normal subgroup of G,
and the quotient group G/K is isomorphic to the image of f.

EXAMPLE B.3 Let G be the group of real numbers under addition, and let G0 be the group of positive real numbers
under multiplication. The mapping f : G ! G0 deﬁned by f ðaÞ ¼ 2a is a homomorphism because

f ða þ bÞ ¼ 2aþb ¼ 2a 2b ¼ f ðaÞf ðbÞ
In particular, f is bijective, hence, G and G0 are isomorphic.
Let G be the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication, and let G0 be the group of
nonzero real numbers under multiplication. The mapping f : G ! G0 deﬁned by f ð zÞ ¼ jzj is a homomorphism
because
EXAMPLE B.4

f ðz1 z2 Þ ¼ jz1 z2 j ¼ jz1 jjz2 j ¼ f ðz1 Þ f ðz2 Þ
The kernel K of f consists of those complex numbers z on the unit circle—that is, for which jzj ¼ 1. Thus, G=K is
isomorphic to the image of f—that is, to the group of positive real numbers under multiplication.

B.3

Rings, Integral Domains, and Fields

Let R be a nonempty set with two binary operations, an operation of addition (denoted by +) and an
operation of multiplication (denoted by juxtaposition). Then R is called a ring if the following axioms are
satisﬁed:
½R1  For any a; b; c 2 R, we have ða þ bÞ þ c ¼ a þ ðb þ cÞ.
½R2  There exists an element 0 2 R; called the zero element, such that a þ 0 ¼ 0 þ a ¼ a for every
a 2 R:
½R3  For each a 2 R there exists an element a 2 R, called the negative of a, such that
a þ ðaÞ ¼ ðaÞ þ a ¼ 0.
½R4  For any a; b 2 R; we have a þ b ¼ b þ a:
½R5  For any a; b; c 2 R; we have ðabÞc ¼ aðbcÞ:
½R6  For any a; b; c 2 R; we have
(i) aðb þ cÞ ¼ ab þ ac; and (ii) ðb þ cÞa ¼ ba þ ca:
Observe that the axioms ½R1  through ½R4  may be summarized by saying that R is an abelian group
under addition.
Subtraction is deﬁned in R by a  b  a þ ðbÞ.
It can be shown (see Problem B.25) that a  0 ¼ 0  a ¼ 0 for every a 2 R:
R is called a commutative ring if ab ¼ ba for every a; b 2 R: We also say that R is a ring with a unit
element if there exists a nonzero element 1 2 R such that a  1 ¼ 1  a ¼ a for every a 2 R:
A nonempty subset S of R is called a subring of R if S forms a ring under the operations of R. We note
that S is a subring of R if and only if a; b 2 S implies a  b 2 S and ab 2 S.
A nonempty subset I of R is called a left ideal in R if (i) a  b 2 I whenever a; b 2 I; and (ii) ra 2 I
whenever r 2 R; a 2 I: Note that a left ideal I in R is also a subring of R. Similarly, we can deﬁne a right
ideal and a two-sided ideal. Clearly all ideals in commutative rings are two sided. The term ideal shall
mean two-sided ideal uniess otherwise speciﬁed.

406

Appendix B Algebraic Structures

THEOREM B.3:

Let I be a (two-sided) ideal in a ring R. Then the cosets fa þ I j a 2 Rg form a ring
under coset addition and coset multiplication. This ring is denoted by R=I and is
called the quotient ring.

Now let R be a commutative ring with a unit element. For any a 2 R, the set ðaÞ ¼ fra j r 2 Rg is an
ideal; it is called the principal ideal generated by a. If every ideal in R is a principal ideal, then R is called
a principal ideal ring.
DEFINITION:

A commutative ring R with a unit element is called an integral domain if R has no
zero divisors—that is, if ab ¼ 0 implies a ¼ 0 or b ¼ 0.

DEFINITION:

A commutative ring R with a unit element is called a ﬁeld if every nonzero a 2 R has a
multiplicative inverse; that is, there exists an element a1 2 R such that aa1 ¼ a1 a ¼ 1:

A ﬁeld is necessarily an integral domain; for if ab ¼ 0 and a 6¼ 0; then
b ¼ 1  b ¼ a1 ab ¼ a1  0 ¼ 0
We remark that a ﬁeld may also be viewed as a commutative ring in which the nonzero elements form a
group under multiplication.
EXAMPLE B.5 The set Z of integers with the usual operations of addition and multiplication is the classical

example of an integral domain with a unit element. Every ideal I in Z is a principal ideal; that is, I ¼ ðnÞ for
some integer n. The quotient ring Zn ¼ Z=ðnÞ is called the ring of integers module n. If n is prime, then Zn is a ﬁeld.
On the other hand, if n is not prime then Zn has zero divisors. For example, in the ring Z6 ; 
2
3¼
0 and
2 6¼ 0 and 3 6¼ 
0:
EXAMPLE B.6 The rational numbers Q and the real numbers R each form a ﬁeld with respect to the usual
operations of addition and multiplication.
EXAMPLE B.7 Let C denote the set of ordered pairs of real numbers with addition and multiplication deﬁned by

ða; bÞ þ ðc; d Þ ¼ ða þ c; b þ d Þ
ða; bÞ  ðc; d Þ ¼ ðac  bd; ad þ bcÞ
Then C satisﬁes all the required properties of a ﬁeld. In fact, C is just the ﬁeld of complex numbers (see page 4).
EXAMPLE B.8 The set M of all 2 6 2 matrices with real entries forms a noncommutative ring with zero divisors
under the operations of matrix addition and matrix multiplication.
EXAMPLE B.9 Let R be any ring. Then the set R½ x of all polynomials over R forms a ring with respect to the usual
operations of addition and multiplication of polynomials. Moreover, if R is an integral domain then R½ x is also an
integral domain.

Now let D be an integral domain. We say that b divides a in D if a ¼ bc for some c 2 D. An element
u 2 D is called a unit if u divides 1—that is, if u has a multiplicative inverse. An element b 2 D is called
an associate of a 2 D if b ¼ ua for some unit u 2 D. A nonunit p 2 D is said to be irreducible if p ¼ ab
implies a or b is a unit.
An integral domain D is called a unique factorization domain if every nonunit a 2 D can be written
uniquely (up to associates and order) as a product of irreducible elements.
EXAMPLE B.10 The ring Z of integers is the classical example of a unique factorization domain. The units of Z
are 1 and 1. The only associates of n 2 Z are n and n. The irreducible elements of Z are the prime numbers.

Modules

Let M be an additive abelian group and let R be a ring with a unit element. Then M is said to be a (left) Rmodule if there exists a mapping R M ! M that satisﬁes the following axioms:
½M1  rðm1 þ m2 Þ ¼ rm1 þ rm2
½M2  ðr þ sÞm ¼ rm þ sm
½M3  ðrsÞm ¼ rðsmÞ
½M4  1  m ¼ m
for any r; s 2 R and any mi 2 M.
We emphasize that an R-module is a generalization of a vector space where we allow the scalars to
come from a ring rather than a ﬁeld.
EXAMPLE B.12

where n is any positive integer.
EXAMPLE B.13 Let R be a ring and let I be an ideal in R. Then I may be viewed as a module over R.
EXAMPLE B.14 Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld K and let T : V ! V be a linear mapping. We make V into a
module over the ring K ½ x of polynomials over K by deﬁning f ð xÞv ¼ f ðT Þðv Þ: The reader should check that a scalar
multiplication has been deﬁned.

Let M be a module over R. An additive subgroup N of M is called a submodule of M if u 2 N and
k 2 R imply ku 2 N : (Note that N is then a module over R.)
Let M and M 0 be R-modules. A mapping T : M ! M 0 is called a homomorphism (or: R-homomorphism
or R-linear) if
(i) T ðu þ v Þ ¼ T ðuÞ þ T ðv Þ

and

(ii) T ðkuÞ ¼ kT ðuÞ

for every u; v 2 M and every k 2 R.

Polynomials over a Field
C.1

Introduction

We will investigate polynomials over a ﬁeld K and show that they have many properties that are
analogous to properties of the integers. These results play an important role in obtaining canonical forms
for a linear operator T on a vector space V over K.

C.2

Ring of Polynomials

Let K be a ﬁeld. Formally, a polynomial of f over K is an inﬁnite sequence of elements from K in which
all except a ﬁnite number of them are 0:
f ¼ ð. . . ; 0; an ; . . . ; a1 ; a0 Þ
(We write the sequence so that it extends to the left instead of to the right.) The entry ak is called the kth
coefﬁcient of f. If n is the largest integer for which an 6¼ 0, then we say that the degree of f is n, written
deg f ¼ n
We also call an the leading coefﬁcient of f, and if an ¼ 1 we call f a monic polynomial. On the other hand,
if every coefﬁcient of f is 0 then f is called the zero polynomial, written f ¼ 0. The degree of the zero
polynomial is not deﬁned.
Now if g is another polynomial over K, say
g ¼ ð. . . ; 0; bm ; . . . ; b1 ; b0 Þ
then the sum f þ g is the polynomial obtained by adding corresponding coefﬁcients. That is, if m  n, then
f þ g ¼ ð. . . ; 0; an ; . . . ; am þ bm ; . . . ; a1 þ b1 ; a0 þ b0 Þ
Furthermore, the product fg is the polynomial
fg ¼ ð. . . ; 0; an bm ; . . . ; a1 b0 þ a0 b1 ; a0 b0 Þ
that is, the kth coefﬁcient ck of fg is
ck ¼

The following theorem applies.

THEOREM C.1:

The set P of polynomials over a ﬁeld K under the above operations of addition and
multiplication forms a commutative ring with a unit element and with no zero
divisors—an integral domain. If f and g are nonzero polynomials in P, then
deg ð fgÞ ¼ ðdeg f Þðdeg g Þ.

Appendix C Polynomials over a Field

Notation
We identify the scalar a0 2 K with the polynomial
a0 ¼ ð. . . ; 0; a0 Þ
We also choose a symbol, say t, to denote the polynomial
t ¼ ð. . . ; 0; 1; 0Þ
We call the symbol t an indeterminant. Multiplying t with itself, we obtain
t2 ¼ ð. . . ; 0; 1; 0; 0Þ; t3 ¼ ð. . . ; 0; 1; 0; 0; 0Þ; . . .
Thus, the above polynomial f can be written uniquely in the usual form
f ¼ an tn þ    þ as t þ a0
When the symbol t is selected as the indeterminant, the ring of polynomials over K is denoted by
K ½t 
and a polynomial f is frequently denoted by f ðtÞ.
We also view the ﬁeld K as a subset of K ½t under the above identiﬁcation. This is possible because the
operations of addition and multiplication of elements of K are preserved under this identiﬁcation:
ð. . . ; 0; a0 Þ þ ð. . . ; 0; b0 Þ ¼ ð. . . ; 0; a0 þ b0 Þ
ð. . . ; 0; a0 Þ  ð. . . ; 0; b0 Þ ¼ ð. . . ; 0; a0 b0 Þ
We remark that the nonzero elements of K are the units of the ring K ½t.
We also remark that every nonzero polynomial is an associate of a unique monic polynomial. Hence, if
d and d 0 are monic polynomials for which d divides d 0 and d 0 divides d, then d ¼ d 0 . (A polynomial g
divides a polynomial f if there is a polynomial h such that f ¼ hg:)

C.3

Divisibility

The following theorem formalizes the process known as ‘‘long division.’’
THEOREM C.2

(Division Algorithm): Let f and g be polynomials over a ﬁeld K with g 6¼ 0. Then
there exist polynomials q and r such that
f ¼ qg þ r
where either r ¼ 0 or deg r < deg g.

Proof: If f ¼ 0 or if deg f < deg g, then we have the required representation
f ¼ 0g þ f
Now suppose deg f  deg g, say
f ¼ an tn þ    þ a1 t þ a0

and g ¼ bm tm þ    þ b1 t þ b0

where an ; bm 6¼ 0 and n  m. We form the polynomial
a
f1 ¼ f  n tnm g
bm
Then deg f1 < deg f . By induction, there exist polynomials q1 and r such that
f1 ¼ q1 g þ r

ð1Þ

Appendix C Polynomials over a Field

where either r ¼ 0 or deg r < deg g. Substituting this into (1) and solving for f,


a
f ¼ q1 þ n tnm g þ r
bm
which is the desired representation.
The ring K ½t of polynomials over a ﬁeld K is a principal ideal ring. If I is an ideal in
K ½t, then there exists a unique monic polynomial d that generates I, such that d
divides every polynomial f 2 I.

THEOREM C.3:

Proof. Let d be a polynomial of lowest degree in I. Because we can multiply d by a nonzero scalar and
still remain in I, we can assume without loss in generality that d is a monic polynomial. Now suppose
f 2 I. By Theorem C.2 there exist polynomials q and r such that
f ¼ qd þ r where either r ¼ 0 or deg r < deg d
Now f ; d 2 I implies qd 2 I; and hence, r ¼ f  qd 2 I. But d is a polynomial of lowest degree in I.
Accordingly, r ¼ 0 and f ¼ qd; that is, d divides f. It remains to show that d is unique. If d 0 is another
monic polynomial that generates I, then d divides d 0 and d 0 divides d. This implies that d ¼ d 0 , because d
and d 0 are monic. Thus, the theorem is proved.
THEOREM C.4:

Let f and g be nonzero polynomials in K ½t. Then there exists a unique monic
polynomial d such that
(i) d divides f and g; and (ii) d 0 divides f and g, then d 0 divides d.

DEFINITION:

The above polynomial d is called the greatest common divisor of f and g. If d ¼ 1,
then f and g are said to be relatively prime.

Proof of Theorem C.4. The set I ¼ fmf þ ng j m; n 2 K ½tg is an ideal. Let d be the monic polynomial
that generates I. Note f ; g 2 I; hence, d divides f and g. Now suppose d 0 divides f and g. Let J be the ideal
generated by d 0 . Then f ; g 2 J , and hence, I  J . Accordingly, d 2 J and so d 0 divides d as claimed. It
remains to show that d is unique. If d1 is another (monic) greatest common divisor of f and g, then d
divides d1 and d1 divides d. This implies that d ¼ d1 because d and d1 are monic. Thus, the theorem is
proved.
COROLLARY C.5:

Let d be the greatest common divisor of the polynomials f and g. Then there exist
polynomials m and n such that d ¼ mf þ ng. In particular, if f and g are relatively
prime, then there exist polynomials m and n such that mf þ ng ¼ 1.

The corollary follows directly from the fact that d generates the ideal
I ¼ fmf þ ng j m; n 2 K ½tg

C.4

Factorization

A polynomial p 2 K ½t of positive degree is said to be irreducible if p ¼ fg implies f or g is a scalar.
LEMMA C.6:

Suppose p 2 K ½t is irreducible. If p divides the product fg of polynomials f ; g 2 K ½t,
then p divides f or p divides g. More generally, if p divides the product of n
polynomials f1 f2 . . . fn , then p divides one of them.

Proof. Suppose p divides fg but not f. Because p is irreducible, the polynomials f and p must then be
relatively prime. Thus, there exist polynomials m; n 2 K ½t such that mf þ np ¼ 1. Multiplying this

414

Appendix C Polynomials over a Field

equation by g, we obtain mfg þ npg ¼ g. But p divides fg and so mfg, and p divides npg; hence, p divides
the sum g ¼ mfg þ npg.
Now suppose p divides f1 f2    fn : If p divides f1 , then we are through. If not, then by the above result p
divides the product f2    fn : By induction on n, p divides one of the polynomials f2 ; . . . fn : Thus, the
lemma is proved.
THEOREM C.7:

(Unique Factorization Theorem) Let f be a nonzero polynomial in K ½t: Then f can
be written uniquely (except for order) as a product
f ¼ kp1 p2    pn
where k 2 K and the pi are monic irreducible polynomials in K ½t:

Proof: We prove the existence of such a product ﬁrst. If f is irreducible or if f 2 K, then such a product
clearly exists. On the other hand, suppose f ¼ gh where f and g are nonscalars. Then g and h have degrees
less than that of f. By induction, we can assume
g ¼ k1 g1 g2    gr

and h ¼ k2 h1 h2    hs

where k1 ; k2 2 K and the gi and hj are monic irreducible polynomials. Accordingly,
f ¼ ðk1 k2 Þg1 g2    gr k1 h2    hs
is our desired representation.
We next prove uniqueness (except for order) of such a product for f. Suppose
f ¼ kp1 p2    pn ¼ k 0 q1 q2    qm
where k; k 0 2 K and the p1 ; . . . ; pn ; q1; . . . ; qm are monic irreducible polynomials. Now p1 divides
k 0 q1    qm : Because p1 is irreducible, it must divide one of the qi by the above lemma. Say p1 divides q1 .
Because p1 and q1 are both irreducible and monic, p1 ¼ q1 . Accordingly,
kp2    pn ¼ k 0 q2    qm
By induction, we have that n ¼ m and p2 ¼ q2 ; . . . ; pn ¼ qm for some rearrangement of the qi . We also
have that k ¼ k 0 . Thus, the theorem is proved.
If the ﬁeld K is the complex ﬁeld C, then we have the following result that is known as the
fundamental theorem of algebra; its proof lies beyond the scope of this text.

THEOREM C.8:

(Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Let f ðtÞ be a nonzero polynomial over the
complex ﬁeld C. Then f ðtÞ can be written uniquely (except for order) as a product
f ðtÞ ¼ k ðt  r2 Þðt  r2 Þ    ðt  rn Þ
where k; ri 2 C—as a product of linear polynomials.

In the case of the real ﬁeld R we have the following result.
THEOREM C.9:

Let f ðtÞ be a nonzero polynomial over the real ﬁeld R. Then f ðtÞ can be written
uniquely (except for order) as a product
f ðtÞ ¼ kp1 ðtÞp2 ðtÞ    pm ðtÞ
where k 2 R and the pi ðtÞ are monic irreducible polynomials of degree one or two.

Relations and Equivalence Relations

A binary relation or simply relation R from a set A to a set B assigns to each ordered pair ða; bÞ 2 A
exactly one of the following statements:
(i) ‘‘a is related to b,’’ written a R b,
(ii) ‘‘a is not related to b’’ written a R b.
A relation from a set A to the same set A is called a relation on A.
^ of A B as follows:
Observe that any relation R from A to B uniquely deﬁnes a subset R

B

^ ¼ fða; bÞja R bg

^ of A
Conversely, any subset R

B deﬁnes a relation from A to B as follows:

a R b if and only if ða; bÞ 2 R
In view of the above correspondence between relations from A to B and subsets of A
relation from A to B as follows:
DEFINITION D.1:

A relation R from A to B is a subset of A

B, we redeﬁne a

B.

Equivalence Relations
Consider a nonempty set S. A relation R on S is called an equivalence relation if R is reﬂexive,
symmetric, and transitive; that is, if R satisﬁed the following three axioms:
[E1] (Reﬂexivity) Every a 2 A is related to itself. That is, for every a 2 A, a R a.
[E2] (Symmetry) If a is related to b, then b is related to a. That is, if a R b, then b R a.
[E3] (Transitivity) If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. That is,
if a R b and b R c, then a R c:
The general idea behind an equivalence relation is that it is a classiﬁcation of objects that are in some way
‘‘alike.’’ Clearly, the relation of equality is an equivalence relation. For this reason, one frequently uses ~
or  to denote an equivalence relation.
EXAMPLE D.1

(a) In Euclidean geometry, similarity of triangles is an equivalence relation. Speciﬁcally, suppose a; b; g are
triangles. Then (i) a is similar to itself. (ii). If a is similar to b, then b is similar to a. (iii) If a is similar to b and b
is similar to g, then a is similar to g.

Appendix D Odds and Ends

(b) The relation  of set inclusion is not an equivalence relation. It is reﬂexive and transitive, but it is not symmetric
because A  B does not imply B  A.

Equivalence Relations and Partitions
Let S be a nonempty set. Recall ﬁrst that a partition P of S is a subdivision of S into nonempty,
nonoverlapping subsets; that is, a collection P ¼ fAj g of nonempty subsets of S such that (i) Each a 2 S
belong to one of the Aj , (ii) The sets fAj g are mutually disjoint.
The subsets in a partition P are called cells. Thus, each a 2 S belongs to exactly one of the cells. Also,
any element b 2 Aj is called a representative of the cell Aj , and a subset B of S is called a system of
representatives if B contains exactly one element in each of the cells in fAj g.
Now suppose R is an equivalence relation on the nonempty set S. For each a 2 S, the equivalence class
of a, denoted by [a], is the set of elements of S to which a is related:
½a ¼ fx j a Rxg:
The collection of equivalence classes, denoted by S=R, is called the quotient of S by R:
S=R ¼ f½a j a 2 S g
The fundamental property of an equivalence relation and its quotient set is contained in the following
theorem:
THEOREM D.1:

Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set S. Then the quotient set S=R is a
partition of S.

EXAMPLE D.2 Let  be the relation on the set Z of integers deﬁned by

x  yðmod 5Þ
which reads ‘‘x is congruent to y modulus 5’’ and which means that the difference x  y is divisible by 5.
Then  is an equivalence relation on Z.
Then there are exactly ﬁve equivalence classes in the quotient set Z=  as follows:
A0 ¼ f. . . ; 10; 5; 0; 5; 10; . . .g
A1 ¼ f. . . ; 9; 4; 1; 6; 11; . . .g
A2 ¼ f. . . ; 8; 3; 2; 7; 12; . . .g
A3 ¼ f. . . ; 7; 2; 3; 8; 13; . . .g
A4 ¼ f. . . ; 6; 1; 4; 9; 14; . . .g
Note that any integer x, which can be expressed uniquely in the form x ¼ 5q þ r where 0  r < 5, is a
member of the equivalence class Ar where r is the remainder. As expected, the equivalence classes are
disjoint and their union is Z:
Z ¼ A0 [ A1 [ A2 [ A3 [ A4
This quotient set Z= , called the integers modulo 5, is denoted
Z=5Z or simply Z5 :
Usually one chooses f0; 1; 2; 3; 4g or f2; 1; 0; 1; 2g as a system of representatives of the equivalence classes.
Analagously, for any positive integer m, there exists the congruence relation  deﬁned by
x  yðmod mÞ
and the quotient set Z=  is called the integers modulo m.

Generalized (Moore–Penrose) Inverse

Here we assume that the ﬁeld of scalars is the complex ﬁeld C where the matrix AH is the conjugate
transpose of a matrix A. [If A is a real matrix, then AH ¼ AT .]
Let A be an m n matrix over C. A matrix, denoted by Aþ , is called the
pseudoinverse or Morre–Penrose inverse or MP-inverse of A if A satisﬁes the
following four equations:

DEFINITION D.3:

Aþ is unique (when it exists).

Least-Square Solution

Consider a system AX ¼ B of linear equations. A least-square solution of AX ¼ B is the vector of
smallest Euclidean norm that minimizes kAX  Bk2 : That vector is
X ¼ Aþ B
[In case A is invertible, so Aþ ¼ A1 , then X ¼ A1 B, which is the unique solution of the system.]
EXAMPLE D.5 Consider the following system AX ¼ B of linear equations:

x þ y  z þ 2t ¼ 1
2x þ 2y  z þ 3t ¼ 3
x  y þ 2z  3t ¼ 2
